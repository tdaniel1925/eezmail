## 🎯 **STATUS: 80% COMPLETE**

The AI Chatbot is now dramatically more powerful! We've completed two major phases in this session:

---

## ✅ **COMPLETED IN THIS SESSION**

### Phase 4: Context Chaining (100% Complete)
**Revolutionary Feature: Pronoun Resolution**

Users can now have natural, flowing conversations:

**Example Conversations That NOW WORK:**
```
User: "find emails from John"
AI: "Found 5 emails from John Smith..."

User: "email him"  ← AI knows "him" = John Smith
AI: "✨ Email drafted in your personal writing style. Ready to send!"

User: "move it to Archive"  ← AI knows "it" = the email just drafted
AI: "Moved 1 email to Archive"

User: "schedule a meeting with her tomorrow at 2pm"  ← AI knows "her" = last female contact
AI: "Created calendar event with Sarah..."
```

**Technical Implementation:**
- **`src/lib/chat/context-manager.ts`** (New File)
  - Tracks last 20 messages with entity extraction
  - Maps pronouns to entities (it, him, her, them, that, those)
  - Stores last email/contact/event/task IDs
  - Tracks search results for "find it" later
  - Auto-expiry and context cleaning

- **`src/lib/chat/reference-resolver.ts`** (New File)
  - Parses natural language references
  - Resolves ambiguous pronouns ("it", "this", "that email")
  - Suggests clarifications when unclear
  - Provides confidence scores (high/medium/low)
  - Handles complex references ("that meeting", "the task")

- **Integration in Chat API:**
  - Automatic reference resolution before OpenAI call
  - Clarification prompts when ambiguous
  - Context preservation across conversation turns
  - Entity tracking with detailed logging

**Pronouns Supported:**
- "it", "this", "that" → last email/event/task
- "him", "his" → last male contact
- "her", "hers" → last female contact
- "them", "their", "those" → search results or multiple entities
- "that email", "the meeting", "the task" → specific entity types

### Phase 2: Personality Learning (100% Complete)
**Revolutionary Feature: AI Writes Like YOU**

The AI now analyzes your sent emails and learns your unique writing style!

**What Gets Learned:**
- ✅ Tone (professional, casual, friendly, formal)
- ✅ Formality level (very formal → very informal)
- ✅ Common phrases you use
- ✅ Vocabulary level (simple, moderate, advanced)
- ✅ Typical email length
- ✅ Greeting style ("Hi", "Hey", "Hello", etc.)
- ✅ Closing style ("Best", "Thanks", "Cheers", etc.)
- ✅ Emoji usage (yes/no)
- ✅ Active hours (when you send most emails)
- ✅ Top 20 frequent contacts
- ✅ Top 10 common topics from subjects

**Technical Implementation:**
- **`src/lib/ai/user-profile.ts`** (New File - 320 lines)
  - `analyzeWritingStyle()` - Analyzes last 50 sent emails from 60 days
  - Uses GPT-4 to detect tone, formality, vocabulary
  - Calculates active hours from email timestamps
  - Extracts frequent contacts and topics
  - Auto-refreshes every 7 days
  - `getWritingStyleProfile()` - Retrieves profile with auto-refresh
  - `applyUserStyleToText()` - Rewrites text in user's style
  - `getProfileStats()` - Display profile statistics

- **`src/lib/ai/personalized-compose.ts`** (New File - 240 lines)
  - `composeWithPersonality()` - Generates emails in user's exact voice
  - Enhanced system prompt with user's style characteristics
  - `rewriteInUserStyle()` - Adjusts existing emails
  - `generateSubjectLine()` - Creates subject in user's style
  - Options: makeShorter, makeLonger, morePersonal, moreProfessional

- **Database Integration:**
  - Uses `user_ai_profiles` table (created in previous session)
  - Stores all learned patterns in structured JSONB
  - Tracks `lastAnalyzedAt` for auto-refresh logic
  - `totalEmailsAnalyzed` count for transparency

- **Integration:**
  - Updated `src/lib/chat/compose-actions.ts`
    - Added `userId` parameter
    - Uses `composeWithPersonality()` when userId provided
    - Falls back to generic composition if profile unavailable
    - Returns `personalityApplied: true` flag
  
  - Updated `src/app/api/chat/execute/route.ts`
    - Passes `user.id` to composeNewEmail
    - Special message: "✨ Email drafted in your personal writing style"

**User Experience:**
```
User: "email Jason about the project update"

WITHOUT personality learning:
"Dear Jason, I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to provide you with an update regarding the project..."

WITH personality learning (if user writes casually):
"Hey Jason, Quick update on the project - things are moving along nicely! Let me know if you have questions. Thanks!"
```
