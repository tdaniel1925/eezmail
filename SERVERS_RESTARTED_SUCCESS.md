# âœ… SERVERS RESTARTED - NEW CODE ACTIVE!

## ðŸŽ‰ What Was Fixed:

### **1. Email Categorization Logic**

- **Sent emails** â†’ Now categorized as `archived` (won't show in inbox)
- **Drafts** â†’ Now categorized as `unscreened`
- **Trash/Deleted** â†’ Now categorized as `archived`
- **Custom folders** â†’ Now categorized as `unscreened`

### **2. Folder Sync Status**

âœ… **All 13 folders ARE being synced:**

1. 1---infinity-concepts
2. archive
3. conversation-history
4. trash
5. drafts
6. inbox
7. spam
8. levins
9. outbox
10. rss-feeds
11. sam-and-scott-levin
12. sent
13. sync-issues

## ðŸ“‹ NEXT STEPS:

### **Step 1: Fix Existing Email Categories**

Run this SQL script in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- FIX SENT EMAIL CATEGORIES
-- This will re-categorize all existing sent/drafts/trash emails correctly

-- Re-categorize sent emails to 'archived'
UPDATE emails
SET email_category = 'archived'
WHERE folder_name IN ('sent', 'sentitems', 'Sent Items')
  AND account_id = '26ddbb0d-12f4-422b-8a33-fd1e8072e33c';

-- Re-categorize drafts to 'unscreened'
UPDATE emails
SET email_category = 'unscreened'
WHERE folder_name = 'drafts'
  AND account_id = '26ddbb0d-12f4-422b-8a33-fd1e8072e33c';

-- Re-categorize trash/deleted to 'archived'
UPDATE emails
SET email_category = 'archived'
WHERE folder_name IN ('trash', 'deleteditems', 'deleted', 'Deleted Items')
  AND account_id = '26ddbb0d-12f4-422b-8a33-fd1e8072e33c';

-- Verify the changes
SELECT
  folder_name,
  email_category,
  COUNT(*) as email_count
FROM emails
WHERE account_id = '26ddbb0d-12f4-422b-8a33-fd1e8072e33c'
GROUP BY folder_name, email_category
ORDER BY folder_name;

SELECT 'âœ… Email categories fixed! Sent emails are no longer in inbox category.' as status_message;
```

### **Step 2: Check Your Inbox**

1. Go to: **http://localhost:3000/dashboard/inbox**
2. You should now see **ONLY inbox emails** (no sent emails!)
3. Your inbox should show the correct count (~1,261 emails)

### **Step 3: Verify the Sync (Optional)**

If you want to test the new categorization with a fresh sync:

1. Run the SQL reset: `FINAL_FRESH_SYNC_RESET.sql`
2. Go to: **http://localhost:3000/dashboard/settings?tab=email-accounts**
3. Click **"Sync Now"**
4. Watch the terminal - all folders will sync with correct categories!

## ðŸ“Š WHAT TO EXPECT:

âœ… **Inbox View:**

- Shows ~1,261 emails (only from Inbox folder)
- NO sent emails
- NO drafts
- NO trash

âœ… **All Folders Syncing:**

- All 13 folders are being downloaded
- Each folder has correct category assignment
- `folderName` field preserves original folder name for filtering

âœ… **Future Syncs:**

- New emails will be categorized correctly

## ðŸŽ¯ SUCCESS CRITERIA:

After running the SQL script, your inbox should:

1. âœ… Only show emails from the "Inbox" folder
2. âœ… NOT show any sent emails
3. âœ… Have the correct count (~1,261)
4. âœ… Refresh the page and verify the count is accurate
