### **2. Database Seed Script** (`scripts/seed-pricing-tiers.ts`)

- 🌱 Creates 8 tier records (monthly + annual for each of 4 tiers)
- 🌱 Populates all features with unlimited (-1) values

### **3. Package.json** (`package.json`)

**Added:**

```json
"seed:pricing": "tsx scripts/seed-pricing-tiers.ts"
```

### **4. Admin Pricing System** (Already Exists)

- ✅ Dynamic tier creation/editing
- ✅ Feature management
- ✅ Stripe integration
- ✅ Active/inactive toggling
- ✅ "Most Popular" highlighting

---

## 🎯 Admin SMS Pricing Control

### **How It Works:**

The new pricing structure includes "SMS at admin-set rate" in all tiers. This gives you flexibility to:

1. **Set custom SMS pricing per user** (e.g., some users pay $0.01/SMS, others $0.02/SMS)
2. **Set custom pricing per organization** (e.g., Enterprise customers get lower SMS rates)
3. **Change rates without changing the base subscription pricing**

### **Implementation Options:**

#### **Option A: Simple Global Rate**

Add a system setting in `/admin/settings`:

```typescript
{
  globalSmsRate: 0.01, // $0.01 per SMS for everyone
}
```

#### **Option B: User-Level Custom Rates**

Extend the `users` table with an `smsRate` field:

```typescript
// In src/db/schema.ts
smsRate: decimal('sms_rate', { precision: 10, scale: 4 }).default('0.01');
```

#### **Option C: Tier-Based Rates**

Add SMS rate to `tierFeatures`:

```typescript
// Individual: $0.02/SMS
// Team: $0.015/SMS
// Enterprise: $0.01/SMS
// Platform: $0.008/SMS
```

**Recommendation:** Start with Option A (global rate), then upgrade to Option B or C based on customer needs.

## 🚀 Next Steps

### **1. Seed the Database**

```bash
npm run seed:pricing
```

This will populate your database with all 4 tiers (monthly + annual versions).

### **2. Configure Stripe Products**

For each tier, you need to create Stripe products:

```bash
# Individual Monthly
stripe products create \
  --name "Individual" \
  --description "Perfect for solo professionals"

stripe prices create \
  --product prod_XXX \
  --unit-amount 4500 \
  --currency usd \
  --recurring[interval]=month

# Individual Annual
stripe prices create \
  --product prod_XXX \
  --unit-amount 3600 \
  --currency usd \
  --recurring[interval]=year

# Repeat for Team, Enterprise, and Platform...
```

**Or** use the Stripe Dashboard:

1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/products
2. Click "Add product"
3. Enter name, description, and pricing
4. Get the `price_id` and add it to the tier in `/admin/pricing`

### **3. Set Up SMS Pricing**

Choose one of the implementation options above and configure:

- Navigate to `/admin/settings` (if using global rate)
- Or configure per-user rates in `/admin/users`
- Or add SMS rate as a tier feature in `/admin/pricing`

### **4. Test Signup Flow**

1. Visit `/signup?plan=individual` and ensure it works
2. Visit `/signup?plan=team` and ensure it works
3. Visit `/signup?plan=enterprise` and ensure it works
4. Visit `/signup?plan=platform` and ensure it redirects to contact sales

### **5. Update Marketing Materials**

- ✅ Landing page pricing section - **DONE**
- ✅ Dedicated pricing page - **DONE**
- ⚠️ Email templates (mention 30-day trial, not 14-day)
- ⚠️ Onboarding emails
- ⚠️ Sales collateral

## 📋 Pricing Comparison

### **Before:**

- Individual: $45/month (1 user)
- Team: $175/month (5 users minimum) = $35/user
- Enterprise: $150/month (6 users minimum) = $25/user

### **After:**

- Individual: $45/month (1 user)
- Team: $35/user (2-5 users) - **NEW: starts at 2 users**
- Enterprise: $30/user (6-15 users) - **PRICE INCREASE** from $25
- Platform: $25/user (15+ users) - **NEW TIER**

**Why the Enterprise price increase?**

- More consistent pricing ladder ($45 → $35 → $30 → $25)
- Platform tier now offers best value for large teams
- Easier to upsell: "Add 10 more users and save $5/user"

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Database Schema (Already Exists):**

```typescript
// src/db/schema.ts
export const pricingTiers = pgTable('pricing_tiers', {
  id: uuid('id').primaryKey(),
  name: text('name').notNull(),
  slug: text('slug').unique(),
  price: decimal('price', { precision: 10, scale: 2 }),
  interval: text('interval').default('month'),
  isActive: boolean('is_active').default(true),
  isHighlighted: boolean('is_highlighted'),
  stripePriceId: text('stripe_price_id'),
  // ... other fields
});

export const tierFeatures = pgTable('tier_features', {
  id: uuid('id').primaryKey(),
  tierId: uuid('tier_id').references(() => pricingTiers.id),
  featureName: text('feature_name'),
  featureValue: integer('feature_value'), // -1 = unlimited
  // ... other fields
});
```

### **Stripe Integration:**

When users subscribe:

1. Detect team size during signup
2. Automatically select correct tier:
   - 1 user → Individual ($45)
   - 2-5 users → Team ($35)
   - 6-15 users → Enterprise ($30)
   - 15+ users → Contact sales or Platform ($25)
3. Create Stripe subscription with correct `price_id`
4. Store `pricingTier` in `users` or `organizations` table
