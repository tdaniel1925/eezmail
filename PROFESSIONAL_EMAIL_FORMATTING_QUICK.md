## 🔧 How It Works

1. Checks `email_signatures` table for default signature
2. Extracts name from signature HTML if available
3. Falls back to `users.fullName` and `users.email`
4. Uses placeholders `[Your Name]` if no data found
5. AI generates email with signature embedded in format

## 💾 Data Source Priority

1. **First**: Email signature name + email
2. **Second**: User profile fullName + email
3. **Last**: Placeholders `[Your Name]` + `[your.email@example.com]`

## 🎯 Spacing Rules

- `\n\n` = Double line break (blank line between sections)
- `\n` = Single line break (name to email)

## 📊 TypeScript Status

✅ **0 errors** in all modified files
