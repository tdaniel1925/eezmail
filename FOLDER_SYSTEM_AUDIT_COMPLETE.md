# Folder System Audit - Complete ✅

## Overview
Completed comprehensive audit of all email folders in the sidebar to ensure:
1. Every folder has a corresponding functional page
2. Clear distinction between system folders and user-manipulatable folders
3. 2-way sync enabled for all appropriate folders

---

## System Folders (Non-Deletable)

These are **core application folders** that **cannot be deleted or moved** by users. They are permanent parts of the email system.

### ✅ All System Folders Have Functional Pages

| Folder | Path | Description | 2-Way Sync | Status |
|--------|------|-------------|------------|--------|
| **Inbox** | `/dashboard/inbox` | Main inbox for incoming emails | ✅ Yes | ✅ Functional |
| **Sent** | `/dashboard/sent` | All sent emails | ✅ Yes | ✅ Functional |
| **Drafts** | `/dashboard/drafts` | Email drafts with auto-save | ✅ Yes | ✅ Functional |
| **Attachments** | `/dashboard/attachments` | All attachments across folders | ❌ Read-only | ✅ Functional |
| **Unified Inbox** | `/dashboard/all` | All emails from all accounts | ❌ Read-only | ✅ Functional |
| **Spam** | `/dashboard/spam` | Spam and junk emails | ✅ Yes | ✅ Functional |
| **Trash** | `/dashboard/trash` | Deleted emails (30-day retention) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Functional |
| **Archive** | `/dashboard/archive` | Archived emails | ✅ Yes | ✅ Functional |
| **Starred** | `/dashboard/starred` | Starred/flagged emails | ✅ Yes | ✅ Functional |
| **Scheduled** | `/dashboard/scheduled` | Emails scheduled to send later | ❌ Local only | ✅ Functional |

## Provider-Synced Folders (User-Manipulatable)

These folders are **synced from email providers** (Gmail, Outlook, etc.) and **can be fully manipulated** by users with **full 2-way sync**.

### 📧 Synced Folders

- **Source:** Fetched dynamically from `email_folders` table via `getEmailFolders({ accountId })`
- **Display:** Shown in "Email Folders" section of sidebar
- **Page Route:** `/dashboard/folder/[folderId]` (dynamic route)

### User Actions (All Synced to Provider):
✅ **Rename folders** - Changes sync to email provider  
✅ **Create new folders** - Created on email provider  
✅ **Delete folders** - Deleted from email provider  
✅ **Move emails between folders** - Moves synced to provider  
✅ **Reorder folders** - Local preference only  

### 2-Way Sync: **FULLY ENABLED**
All changes made in the app are **immediately synced** back to the email provider (Gmail, Outlook, etc.), and vice versa.

### Examples of Synced Folders:
- 📁 Projects
- 📁 Work
- 📁 Personal
- 📁 Clients
- 📁 Archive (provider-specific)
- 📁 All Mail (Gmail-specific)
- And any other custom folders created by the user in their email provider

---

## Custom Labels (Local Only)

These are **user-created labels** that are **local to the application** and **not synced** to email providers.

### 🏷️ Custom Labels

- **Source:** Stored in `custom_folders` table
- **Display:** Shown in "Labels" section of sidebar (collapsible)
- **Page Route:** `/dashboard/[folder]` (dynamic route)

### User Actions (Local Only):
✅ **Create new labels**  
✅ **Rename labels**  
✅ **Delete labels**  
✅ **Assign colors**  
✅ **Apply to emails**  
✅ **Reorder labels**  

### 2-Way Sync: **NOT APPLICABLE**
These are app-only organizational tools and are **not synced** to email providers.

### Examples of Custom Labels:
- 🔴 Urgent
- 🟢 Follow Up
- 🔵 Important
- 🟡 Waiting
- 🟣 Review

---

## Folder Descriptions for UI

Each folder should clearly indicate its type and whether it can be modified:

### System Folders:
```
📥 Inbox
System folder - Cannot be deleted or renamed
Synced with your email provider
```

### Synced Provider Folders:
```
📁 Projects
Provider folder - Fully customizable
Changes are synced to Gmail/Outlook/etc.
You can rename, delete, or move this folder
```

### Custom Labels:
```
🏷️ Urgent
Local label - App-only organization
Not synced to your email provider
You can rename or delete this label anytime
```

---

## Dynamic Routing Implementation

### Main Dynamic Route: `/dashboard/[folder]/page.tsx`
Handles ALL folder types:
- System folders (inbox, sent, drafts, etc.)
- Synced provider folders
- Custom labels

### Specific Folder Route: `/dashboard/folder/[folderId]/page.tsx`
Handles specific folder IDs for synced folders from providers.

---

## Filtering Logic in Sidebar

The sidebar (`FolderList.tsx`) ensures **no duplicates** by filtering out folders that are already shown in the primary/standard sections:

```typescript
// Excluded folder types (shown in primary/standard sections)
const excludedTypes = ['inbox', 'sent', 'drafts', 'trash', 'spam', 'archive', 'starred'];

// Filter synced folders to show only custom ones
const uniqueFolders = result.folders.filter(folder => 
  !excludedTypes.includes(folder.folderType.toLowerCase())
);
```

---

## Summary

✅ **All 10 system folders have corresponding functional pages**  
✅ **System folders are clearly marked as non-deletable**  
✅ **2-way sync is enabled for all appropriate folders**  
✅ **Users can fully manipulate synced provider folders**  
✅ **Custom labels work as local-only organization tools**  
✅ **Dynamic routing handles all folder types correctly**  
✅ **No duplicate folders in sidebar**
