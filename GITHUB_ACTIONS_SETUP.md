# ðŸš€ GitHub Actions Setup - Step by Step

Follow these steps EXACTLY to enable fully automated deployments.

---

## Step 1: Get Your Vercel Tokens (2 minutes)

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Create a deployment token
vercel token create

# Copy the token that appears - you'll need it!
```

Now get your project IDs:

```bash
# Get organization ID
vercel org ls
# Copy your organization ID

# Get project ID
vercel project ls
# Copy your project ID
```

**Write these down:**

- `VERCEL_TOKEN`: (the token you just created)
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID`: (your org ID)
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`: (your project ID)

---

## Step 2: Add GitHub Secrets (3 minutes)

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Click **Secrets and variables** â†’ **Actions**
4. Click **New repository secret**

Add these secrets ONE BY ONE:

### Vercel Secrets:

```
Name: VERCEL_TOKEN
Value: <paste-your-vercel-token>

Name: VERCEL_ORG_ID
Value: <paste-your-org-id>

Name: VERCEL_PROJECT_ID
Value: <paste-your-project-id>
```

### Database & Supabase Secrets:

```
Name: DATABASE_URL
Value: <copy from your .env.local>

Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
Value: <copy from your .env.local>

Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
Value: <copy from your .env.local>

Name: SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
Value: <copy from your .env.local>
```

### OAuth Secrets:

```
Name: MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID
Value: <copy from your .env.local>

Name: MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET
Value: <copy from your .env.local>

Name: GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
Value: <copy from your .env.local>

Name: GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
Value: <copy from your .env.local>
```

### App URL:

```
Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL
Value: https://easemail.app
(or your production URL)
```

---

## Step 3: Commit and Push (1 minute)

The workflow file is already created at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

Just commit and push:

```bash
# Commit the workflow
git add .github/workflows/deploy.yml
git commit -m "Add automated CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin main
```

---

## Step 4: Verify It Works (2 minutes)

1. Go to your GitHub repo
2. Click **Actions** tab
3. You should see a workflow running!
4. Click on it to watch the progress

Expected output:

```
âœ… Validate Deployment
   â”œâ”€ Checkout code
   â”œâ”€ Setup Node.js
   â”œâ”€ Install dependencies
   â”œâ”€ TypeScript type check
   â”œâ”€ Run linter
   â”œâ”€ Validate deployment readiness
   â””â”€ Run integration tests

âœ… Deploy to Production
   â”œâ”€ Install Vercel CLI
   â”œâ”€ Build Project
   â”œâ”€ Deploy to Production
   â””â”€ Health check
```

---

## Step 5: Test It! (1 minute)

Make a small change and push:

```bash
# Make a small change (or just an empty commit)
git commit --allow-empty -m "Test automated deployment"
git push origin main

# Watch the magic happen in GitHub Actions!
```

---

## âœ… Success Checklist

You'll know it's working when:

- [ ] GitHub Actions runs automatically on push
- [ ] All validation checks pass (green checkmarks)
- [ ] Vercel deployment succeeds
- [ ] Health check returns 200 OK
- [ ] You get a notification if anything fails

---

## ðŸŽ¯ What Happens Now?

### Every time you push code:

```bash
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push
```

**Automatically:**

1. âœ… Validates environment variables
2. âœ… Runs TypeScript checks
3. âœ… Runs linting
4. âœ… Validates critical code patterns
5. âœ… Builds project
6. âœ… Deploys to Vercel
7. âœ… Runs health check
8. âœ… Notifies you if anything fails

**Time:** 2-3 minutes, fully automated

---

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### "Workflow doesn't run"

- Check that `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` exists
- Make sure you pushed to `main` branch
- Check GitHub Actions is enabled in repo settings

### "Vercel deployment fails"

- Verify VERCEL_TOKEN is correct
- Check VERCEL_ORG_ID matches your organization
- Ensure VERCEL_PROJECT_ID is correct

### "Validation fails"

- Check all environment variables are set in GitHub Secrets
- Run `node validate-deployment.js` locally to see what's missing

### "Health check fails"

- Wait a bit longer (deployment might still be rolling out)
- Check your production URL is correct in NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL

---

## ðŸ“Š What You Get

### Before:

```
You: npm run type-check
You: npm run lint
You: npm run pre-deploy
You: git push
You: vercel --prod
You: check logs
You: verify deployment
Total: 30 minutes
```

### After:

```
You: git push
GitHub Actions: Does everything above automatically
Total: 0 minutes (of your time)
```

---

## ðŸŽ‰ You're Done!

**Congratulations!** Your email sync system now has:

- âœ… **Automated validation** before deployment
- âœ… **Automated deployment** to production
- âœ… **Automated health checks** after deployment
- âœ… **Automated client onboarding** (already working)
- âœ… **Automated email sync** (already working)
- âœ… **100% scalable** - handle unlimited clients

**You can now focus on building features while everything else runs automatically!**

---

## ðŸš€ Next Steps (Optional)

### Add Monitoring

1. Set up UptimeRobot: https://uptimerobot.com
2. Monitor: `https://easemail.app/api/health/detailed`
3. Get alerted if site goes down

### Add Error Tracking

```bash
npm install @sentry/nextjs
```

### Add Slack Notifications

Update `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to notify your Slack channel on deployments.
