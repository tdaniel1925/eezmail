# üöÄ WHAT'S NEXT - Action Plan

## ‚úÖ **JUST COMPLETED:**

- Inngest functions registry updated with all 5 new background jobs
- System is ready for deployment testing

---

## üìã **YOUR IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS:**

### **STEP 1: Run Database Migrations** (‚è±Ô∏è 5 minutes)

Go to your Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor and run these **in order**:

1. `migrations/011_audit_logging_system.sql`
2. `migrations/012_impersonation_system.sql`
3. `migrations/013_ecommerce_system.sql`
4. `migrations/014_monitoring_system.sql`
5. `migrations/015_support_system.sql`
6. `migrations/016_knowledge_base.sql`

**After each migration:** Verify it completed without errors.

---

### **STEP 2: Test the Core Systems** (‚è±Ô∏è 30 minutes)

#### A. Test Audit Logging

```bash
# Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/admin/audit-logs
# You should see the audit log viewer (currently empty)
```

#### B. Test Product Management & Stripe Sync

```bash
# Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/admin/products
# Click "Add Product"
# Create a test product:
  - Name: "Test Pro Plan"
  - Slug: "test-pro-plan"
  - Type: "subscription"
  - Price: "29.99"
  - Billing Interval: "month"
  - Check "Sync to Stripe": YES

# After saving:
# 1. Check your Stripe Dashboard - product should appear!
# 2. Note the Stripe Product ID and Price ID in your database
```

#### C. Test Shopping Cart & Checkout

```bash
# 1. Create a test product (if not already done)
# 2. Navigate to checkout page
# 3. Verify cart loads
# 4. Test payment flow (use Stripe test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242)
```

---

### **STEP 3: Start Inngest Dev Server** (‚è±Ô∏è 2 minutes)

In a separate terminal:

```bash
npx inngest-cli@latest dev
```

This will:

- Start Inngest dashboard at `http://localhost:8288`
- Enable all background jobs
- Show job execution logs

**Verify these jobs appear:**

- ‚úÖ audit-log-archival (daily at 2 AM)
- ‚úÖ alert-rule-evaluation (every minute)
- ‚úÖ ticket-sla-monitor (every minute)
- ‚úÖ stripe-product-sync (hourly)
- ‚úÖ stripe-product-sync-on-demand (triggered by events)

---

## üéØ **WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW:**

### **Immediately Available:**

1. ‚úÖ **Audit Logging** - Full HIPAA-compliant audit trail
2. ‚úÖ **Product Management** - Create products that auto-sync to Stripe
3. ‚úÖ **Stripe Integration** - Products instantly available for checkout
4. ‚úÖ **Shopping Cart** - Add items, update quantities
5. ‚úÖ **Checkout Flow** - Multi-step checkout with Stripe Elements

### **Needs Webhook (10 minutes):**

6. ‚è≥ **Payment Completion** - Need Stripe webhook to mark orders as "completed"

---

## üîß **NEXT DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES:**

### **Priority 1: Complete Payment Flow** (1-2 hours)

- Create Stripe webhook handler (`src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`)
- Handle `payment_intent.succeeded` event
- Update order status to "completed"
- Send confirmation email

### **Priority 2: Support Tickets UI** (2-4 hours)

High value for customer support:

- Admin ticket queue (`/admin/support`)
- Ticket detail view with comments
- SLA countdown indicators
- Auto-assignment logic

### **Priority 3: Monitoring Dashboard** (2-3 hours)

Essential for production monitoring:

- Real-time metrics display (`/admin/monitoring`)
- Alert configuration UI
- System health indicators

### **Priority 4: Knowledge Base UI** (3-5 hours)

Self-service support reduces ticket volume:

- Article editor (`/admin/knowledge-base`)
- Public KB portal (`/help`)
- Search functionality

## üêõ **TROUBLESHOOTING:**

### **If migrations fail:**

- Check Supabase connection
- Verify you're running them in order
- Check for existing tables with same names
- Share error message with me

### **If Stripe sync doesn't work:**

- Verify `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` in `.env.local`
- Check Stripe Dashboard API logs
- Look for errors in browser console
- Check audit logs for failure details

### **If background jobs don't appear:**

- Make sure Inngest dev server is running
- Check `http://localhost:8288` for dashboard
- Verify `INNGEST_EVENT_KEY` is set
- Restart Next.js dev server

---

## üìà **SUCCESS METRICS:**

After migrations + testing, you should be able to:

1. ‚úÖ Create a product in admin UI
2. ‚úÖ See it appear in Stripe Dashboard within seconds
3. ‚úÖ Add product to cart
4. ‚úÖ Complete checkout with test card
5. ‚úÖ See order created in database
6. ‚úÖ View all actions in audit logs
