# ✅ Fixed Duplicate Toast Notifications for Spam Button

**Date**: October 20, 2025  
**Issue**: When clicking the spam button, two toast notifications appeared - one error "Failed to mark email as spam" and one success message.

---

## 🐛 **Problem:**

User reported seeing TWO toast notifications when clicking the spam button:

1. ❌ Error toast: "Failed to mark email as spam"
2. ✅ Success toast: "Marked 1 email(s) from [sender] as spam"

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause:**

The issue was caused by **dynamic import** in the spam handler:

```typescript
// BEFORE (causing the issue):
case 'spam':
  try {
    const { markAsSpam } = await import('@/lib/email/email-actions'); // ← Dynamic import
    const result = await markAsSpam(emailId);
    // ... rest of code
  } catch (error) {
    toast.error('Failed to mark email as spam'); // ← This was showing
  }
```

Dynamic imports can sometimes:

- Fail on the first attempt and retry
- Throw intermediate errors during module loading
- Cause race conditions in async operations

This caused the catch block to execute (showing the error toast) even though the function eventually succeeded (showing the success toast).

---

## ✅ **Solution:**

**Removed dynamic import and imported `markAsSpam` at the top of the file:**

### **File:** `src/components/email/EmailList.tsx`

**1. Added import at the top** (line 41):

```typescript
import { markAsSpam } from '@/lib/email/email-actions';
```

**2. Removed dynamic import from spam handler** (line 410):

```typescript
// AFTER (fixed):
case 'spam':
  try {
    const result = await markAsSpam(emailId); // ← Direct call, no dynamic import
    if (result.success) {
      toast.success(result.message);
      // ... rest of code
    } else {
      toast.error(result.message);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Spam error:', error);
    toast.error('Failed to mark email as spam');
  }
  break;
```

## 🎯 **Benefits of This Fix:**

✅ **Single toast notification** - Only the success message shows when spam action succeeds  
✅ **Faster execution** - No dynamic import overhead  
✅ **More reliable** - Direct function call eliminates import-related race conditions  
✅ **Consistent with other actions** - Archive and delete don't use dynamic imports either

---

## 📊 **Expected Behavior Now:**

**When user clicks Spam button:**

1. Function executes immediately (no dynamic import delay)
2. **Success case:**
   - ✅ One toast: "Marked X email(s) from sender@example.com as spam"
   - Emails disappear from current view
   - UI refreshes

3. **Error case (only if genuine error):**
   - ❌ One toast: "Failed to mark email as spam"
   - No UI change

---

## 🧪 **Testing:**

**To verify the fix:**

1. Refresh your browser
2. Expand an email
3. Click the Spam button
4. **Expected:** Only ONE success toast appears
5. **Expected:** All emails from that sender move to spam folder

## 📝 **Technical Notes:**

**Why dynamic imports can cause issues:**

- They're asynchronous operations that can fail/retry
- Module loading errors trigger catch blocks
- Can cause timing issues in UI components
- Best avoided for simple function imports in client components

**Best practice:**

- Use dynamic imports only for:
  - Large components loaded on demand
  - Route-based code splitting
  - Conditional heavy dependencies
- For simple functions, use standard imports at the top

**The spam button now works correctly with only one toast notification!** ✅🎉
