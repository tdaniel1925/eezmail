# Attachment "From" Column Fix

## Issue

Runtime error: "Objects are not valid as a React child (found: [object Error])"

This occurred when the attachments page tried to render the "From" column, which was attempting to display an Error object or malformed data instead of a string.

## Root Cause

The `fromAddress` field from the database (stored as JSON) could potentially be:

- An Error object
- A malformed object
- `null` or `undefined`

React was trying to render these non-string values directly, causing the crash.

## Solution

### 1. Frontend Fix (AttachmentListView.tsx)

Added comprehensive error handling and type checking:

- Wrapped the fromAddress rendering in a try-catch block
- Added explicit checks for Error objects
- Validated that we have a plain object with expected properties
- Ensured only string values are returned for rendering
- Fallback to "Unknown" for any invalid data

```typescript
{
  (() => {
    try {
      const fromAddress = (attachment as any).email?.fromAddress;

      // Handle null/undefined
      if (!fromAddress) return 'Unknown';

      // Handle Error objects or non-plain objects
      if (fromAddress instanceof Error) {
        console.warn('fromAddress is an Error object:', fromAddress);
        return 'Unknown';
      }

      // Ensure it's a plain object with expected properties
      if (typeof fromAddress === 'object' && fromAddress !== null) {
        // Type-safe property access
        const name = fromAddress.name;
        const email = fromAddress.email;

        // Return string values only
        if (typeof name === 'string' && name) return name;
        if (typeof email === 'string' && email) return email;
      }

      return 'Unknown';
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error rendering fromAddress:', error);
      return 'Unknown';
    }
  })();
}
```

### 2. Backend Fix (route.ts)

Added error handling when transforming the data:

- Safely parse fromAddress before including it in the response
- Catch any serialization errors
- Set to null if invalid
- Log errors for debugging

```typescript
const allAttachments = allAttachmentsRaw.map((att) => {
  // Safely parse fromAddress to ensure it's a valid object
  let fromAddress = null;
  try {
    if (att.emailFromAddress && typeof att.emailFromAddress === 'object') {
      fromAddress = att.emailFromAddress;
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error parsing fromAddress for attachment:', att.id, error);
    fromAddress = null;
  }

  return {
    // ... other fields
    email: {
      fromAddress: fromAddress,
      subject: att.emailSubject || null,
    },
  };
});
```

## Testing

- Build completed successfully: ✓
- No TypeScript errors: ✓
- Runtime protection against invalid data: ✓

## Impact

- Prevents crashes when viewing the attachments page
- Gracefully handles malformed database data
- Provides better error logging for debugging
- Shows "Unknown" for attachments without valid sender information

## Files Changed

1. `src/components/attachments/AttachmentListView.tsx`
2. `src/app/api/attachments/route.ts`
