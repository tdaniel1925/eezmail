## Summary
Completed a comprehensive audit of the attachments functionality and fixed the AI chat assistant to use proper text formatting without markdown.

---

## 1. Attachments Page Audit & Fixes

### Issues Found & Fixed:

#### ❌ **Browser Toast Notifications**
- **Problem:** Used `toast` from Sonner library instead of inline notifications
- **Fix:** Replaced all `toast` calls with `InlineNotification` component
- **Files Updated:** `src/app/dashboard/attachments/page.tsx`

#### ❌ **Download Function Not Implemented**
- **Problem:** Download button only showed a toast, did not actually download files
- **Fix:** Implemented complete download logic:
  - Fetches file from `/api/attachments/{id}/download`
  - Creates blob URL and triggers browser download
  - Shows inline success/error notifications
  - Properly cleans up blob URLs

#### ❌ **Delete Function Not Fully Implemented**
- **Problem:** Delete only removed from local state, no API call
- **Fix:** Implemented proper delete logic:
  - Makes DELETE request to `/api/attachments/{id}`
  - Verifies authentication and ownership
  - Deletes from storage and database
  - Shows inline success/error notifications
  - Updates local state only after successful deletion

#### ❌ **No Refresh Functionality**
- **Problem:** No way to refresh attachments list
- **Fix:** Added refresh button in header with loading state

#### ❌ **Error Handling**
- **Problem:** Basic error handling, no detailed feedback
- **Fix:** Enhanced error handling:
  - Session expiration detection (401 errors)
  - Specific error messages for each operation
  - Inline notifications for all error states

### New Features Added:

✅ **Inline Notification System**
- Positioned at top of page
- Auto-dismissible
- Success/error/info states
- Consistent styling across all operations

✅ **Refresh Button**
- Manual refresh capability
- Loading state with spinner
- Success notification after refresh

✅ **Enhanced Delete Logic**
- Confirmation dialog before deletion
- API integration
- Storage cleanup
- Database cleanup

## 2. AI Chat Assistant - Text Formatting Fix

### Issue Found & Fixed:

#### ❌ **Markdown Formatting in Responses**
- **Problem:** AI responses contained markdown syntax (**, *, bullets, etc.)
- **Example:** "**Change Settings or Perform Actions Outside My Defined Capabilities:**"
- **Impact:** Poor readability, unprofessional appearance

### Fix Implemented:

Updated the AI system prompt to explicitly instruct against markdown formatting:

```typescript
## RESPONSE STYLE

- Be helpful and friendly
- Use the user's communication style (casual/professional)
- Provide actionable suggestions
- Confirm understanding before acting
- Explain what you're about to do
- **CRITICAL: Do NOT use markdown formatting** (no asterisks, no bold, no italics, no lists with dashes or bullets)
- Write responses in plain text with proper paragraph structure
- Use natural sentence flow and spacing between paragraphs
- Format lists as numbered items or natural sentences
- Separate thoughts into distinct paragraphs for readability
```

**File Updated:** `src/app/api/chat/route.ts`

### Expected Behavior:

**Before:**
```
**Ambiguous Instructions Without Context:** I perform best with clear and direct instructions. While I can handle references and context to a certain extent, very vague or ambiguous requests without enough context might be challenging. 7.

**Change Settings or Perform Actions Outside My Defined Capabilities:** My functionalities are defined by the specified capabilities within this email management application environment.
```

**After:**
```
Ambiguous Instructions Without Context

I perform best with clear and direct instructions. While I can handle references and context to a certain extent, very vague or ambiguous requests without enough context might be challenging.

Change Settings or Perform Actions Outside My Defined Capabilities

My functionalities are defined by the specified capabilities within this email management application environment. I can't modify system settings, hardware configurations, or software outside of this scope.
```
