# ✅ Webhook Setup Complete!

## What I Did For You

### 1. ✅ Added Cron Job to `vercel.json`

```json
{
  "path": "/api/cron/renew-webhooks",
  "schedule": "0 0 * * *" // Runs daily at midnight UTC
}
```

### 2. ✅ Updated Cron Endpoint

- Now works with Vercel Cron (no secret needed!)
- Auto-renews webhook subscriptions daily
- Located at: `src/app/api/cron/renew-webhooks/route.ts`

### 3. ✅ Environment Variables Already Set

Your `.env.local` already has:

```bash
WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app/api/webhooks/microsoft
WEBHOOK_CLIENT_STATE=ImboxWebhookSecret2024
```

---

## 🚀 Next Steps (You Need To Do These)

### Step 1: Update WEBHOOK_URL (When You Deploy)

After you deploy to Vercel, update `.env.local`:

```bash
# Change this:
WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app/api/webhooks/microsoft

# To your actual Vercel URL:
WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-actual-app-name.vercel.app/api/webhooks/microsoft
```

Also add the same to Vercel Dashboard → Environment Variables

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel

```bash
vercel --prod
```

### Step 3: Add Environment Variables in Vercel

Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables

Add these:

```
WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-actual-app-name.vercel.app/api/webhooks/microsoft
WEBHOOK_CLIENT_STATE=ImboxWebhookSecret2024
```

### Step 4: Test It!

1. Connect a Microsoft email account in your app
2. Check console logs for:
   ```
   ✅ Webhook subscription created: <subscription-id>
   ```
3. Send yourself a test email
4. Watch it appear instantly! ⚡

3. Look for:
   ```

   ```

### Check Active Subscriptions in Database

  ws.*,
