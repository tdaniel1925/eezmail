# Onboarding Center Implementation - Complete

## Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive, professional onboarding system for easeMail with progress tracking, phase-based learning, and sidebar integration.

---

## Implementation Summary

### Phase 1: Database Schema ✅

**File:** `src/db/schema.ts`

Added three new tables:

1. **onboarding_progress** - Tracks user progress through 3 phases (11 steps total)
   - Phase 1: Essential Setup (emailConnected, signatureConfigured, profileCompleted)
   - Phase 2: Quick Wins (aiReplyTried, smartInboxViewed, keyboardShortcutsLearned)
   - Phase 3: Power User (contactsExplored, automationCreated, voiceFeatureTried, chatbotUsed)
   - Meta fields: currentPhase, onboardingCompleted, dismissedOnboarding

2. **onboarding_achievements** - Professional achievements (no cartoons)
   - Tracks achievement unlocks with category (setup, productivity, advanced)

3. **onboarding_tutorials** - Tutorial tracking
   - Records tutorial starts, completions, and time spent

**Type Exports Added:**

- OnboardingProgress / NewOnboardingProgress
- OnboardingAchievement / NewOnboardingAchievement
- OnboardingTutorial / NewOnboardingTutorial

---

### Phase 2: Server Actions ✅

**File:** `src/lib/onboarding/actions.ts`

Created comprehensive server actions:

- `getOnboardingProgress(userId)` - Fetches or creates initial progress
- `updateOnboardingProgress(userId, updates)` - Updates progress with auto-phase advancement
- `unlockAchievement(...)` - Records professional achievements
- `startTutorial(userId, tutorialId)` - Marks tutorial as started
- `completeTutorial(userId, tutorialId, timeSpent)` - Records completion
- `dismissOnboarding(userId)` - Allows users to hide onboarding

**Auto-Phase Advancement Logic:**

- Phase 1 → 2: When all essential setup steps complete
- Phase 2 → 3: When all quick wins complete
- Marks onboardingCompleted when all phases done

---

### Phase 3: UI Components ✅

**Created 3 Professional Components:**

1. **ProgressTracker** (`src/components/onboarding/ProgressTracker.tsx`)
   - Clean progress bar with percentage
   - Shows "X of Y steps complete"
   - Corporate gradient design (primary color)

2. **PhaseCard** (`src/components/onboarding/PhaseCard.tsx`)
   - Displays each phase (Essential Setup, Quick Wins, Power User)
   - Shows locked state for incomplete prerequisites
   - Step-by-step checklist with completion checkmarks
   - "Start" button for tutorial launch
   - Professional green indicators (no cartoons)

3. **OnboardingDashboard** (`src/components/onboarding/OnboardingDashboard.tsx`)
   - Main dashboard component
   - Calculates real-time completion percentage
   - Renders all 3 phase cards
   - "Go to Inbox" action button
   - Responsive layout (max-width 5xl)

---

### Phase 4: Onboarding Page ✅

**File:** `src/app/dashboard/onboarding/page.tsx`

- Server component that fetches user progress
- Authentication check (redirects to login if needed)
- Passes progress data to OnboardingDashboard
- SEO metadata: "Getting Started | easeMail"

---

### Phase 5: API Endpoint ✅

**File:** `src/app/api/onboarding/progress/route.ts`

- GET endpoint for client-side progress fetching
- Used by sidebar widget to display real-time progress
- Returns full onboarding progress object
- Authentication enforced

---

### Phase 6: Sidebar Integration ✅

**Files:**

- `src/components/sidebar/OnboardingNavLink.tsx` (NEW)
- `src/components/sidebar/MainNavigation.tsx` (UPDATED)

**OnboardingNavLink Features:**

- Fetches progress on mount and pathname change
- Shows "Getting Started" with percentage (e.g., "65%")
- Auto-hides when onboarding complete or dismissed
- Active state highlighting
- Professional graduation cap icon

**MainNavigation Update:**

- Added OnboardingNavLink after Tasks
- Only shows when sidebar is expanded (!isCollapsed)

---

### Phase 7: OAuth Callback Update ✅

**File:** `src/app/api/auth/microsoft/callback/route.ts`

**New Flow:**

1. Email account connected successfully
2. Check if first-time user (emailConnected = false)
3. If first-time:
   - Mark emailConnected = true
   - Redirect to `/dashboard/onboarding?from=oauth`
4. If returning user:
   - Redirect to inbox as before

**Benefits:**

- First-time users see onboarding immediately
- Returning users adding second account go straight to inbox
- Natural onboarding trigger point

---

### Phase 8: Welcome Modal ✅

**File:** `src/components/onboarding/WelcomeModal.tsx`

**Features:**

- Optional component (can be added to layout)
- Uses localStorage to track first visit
- Professional design (no cartoons)
- Two CTA buttons:
  - "Get Started (5 min)" → Onboarding page
  - "Skip for now" → Dismiss modal
- Sparkles icon (professional, not cartoonish)

**To Use:**
Import and add to dashboard layout for first-visit detection.
