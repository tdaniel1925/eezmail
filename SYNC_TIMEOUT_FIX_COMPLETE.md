# Sync Timeout Issue - FIXED! üéâ

## What Happened

Your email sync was **working perfectly** - it had synced **1,976+ emails** and was still actively processing. However, the 30-minute safety timeout incorrectly killed it, showing this error:

```
Sync timed out after 30 minutes. Please try syncing again.
```

## The Problem

The old timeout logic was too aggressive:

- ‚ùå **30-minute timeout for ALL syncs** (too short for initial sync of thousands of emails)
- ‚ùå **Didn't check if progress was being made** (just killed any sync after 30 min)
- ‚ùå **No distinction between initial and incremental syncs**

## The Fix ‚úÖ

### 1. Smarter Timeout Logic (`src/lib/sync/sync-orchestrator.ts`)

**Changes:**

- ‚úÖ **2-hour timeout for initial syncs**, 30-min for incremental
- ‚úÖ **Progress-aware** - only resets if NO progress made
- ‚úÖ **Activity check** - verifies sync is truly stuck before resetting
- ‚úÖ **Better logging** - shows why a sync was reset

**Before:**

```typescript
// Always reset after 30 minutes, regardless of progress
setTimeout(
  () => {
    resetSync();
  },
  30 * 60 * 1000
);
```

**After:**

```typescript
// Initial syncs get 2 hours, incremental get 30 min
const timeoutDuration =
  syncMode === 'initial' ? 120 * 60 * 1000 : 30 * 60 * 1000;

// Only reset if:
// 1. No progress was made AND
// 2. No recent updates in last 10 minutes
if (!progressMade && !recentUpdate) {
  resetSync(); // Truly stuck
} else {
  console.log('Sync still active - NOT resetting');
}
```

### 2. Inngest Health Check (`src/lib/inngest/health-check.ts`)

**New file** - Prevents sync attempts when Inngest isn't running:

- ‚úÖ Checks if Inngest dev server is available (localhost:8288)
- ‚úÖ 2-second timeout to avoid blocking
- ‚úÖ Development-only (production uses event keys)
- ‚úÖ Clear error messages

### 3. Health Check API (`src/app/api/inngest/health/route.ts`)

**New endpoint** - `GET /api/inngest/health`

- ‚úÖ Returns health status as JSON
- ‚úÖ Can be polled by UI to show warnings

### 4. Pre-Flight Check in Sync Trigger

**Updated** - Sync won't start if Inngest is down:

```typescript
// 1. Check if Inngest is healthy (in development)
const inngestHealth = await checkInngestHealth();
if (!inngestHealth.healthy) {
  return {
    success: false,
    error: `Cannot start sync: ${inngestHealth.error}`,
  };
}
```

## How This Prevents Future Issues

### ‚úÖ Large Mailbox Support

- Initial syncs now have **2 hours** instead of 30 minutes
- Perfect for mailboxes with thousands of emails

### ‚úÖ Progress Detection

- Checks if `syncProgress` field is updating
- Checks if `updatedAt` timestamp is recent
- Only resets if TRULY stuck with no activity

### ‚úÖ Better Error Messages

- "Sync appears to be stuck" (actual problem)
- vs "Sync timed out" (misleading for active syncs)

### ‚úÖ Inngest Awareness

- Won't try to sync when Inngest isn't running
- Clear error: "Inngest dev server is not running. Start it with: npx inngest-cli@latest dev"

## Current Sync Status

Your sync that was interrupted is likely **still in the database** with `syncStatus = 'syncing'` but will have an error message.

### To Resume Syncing:

**Option 1: Use Browser Console** (Easiest)

```javascript
// Reset and trigger new sync
fetch('/api/email/reset-sync', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ accountId: '6e8e272d-df94-4f75-baa2-6caecc6045d9' }),
})
  .then((r) => r.json())
  .then(() =>
    fetch('/api/email/sync', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        accountId: '6e8e272d-df94-4f75-baa2-6caecc6045d9',
      }),
    })
  )
  .then((r) => r.json())
  .then((data) => console.log('‚úÖ Sync restarted:', data));
```

**Option 2: Wait for Auto-Recovery** (if implemented)
The stuck sync check can be run periodically to auto-reset stuck accounts.

## Testing the Fix

1. **Start Inngest**: `npx inngest-cli@latest dev` (must be running!)
2. **Trigger sync**: Use reset-sync + sync API or UI button
3. **Monitor**: Watch http://localhost:8288 for progress
4. **Result**: Sync will complete even if it takes > 30 minutes!

## Future Improvements (Recommended)

### 1. UI Status Banner

Show warning when Inngest is offline:

```typescript
<InngestStatusBanner />
// Shows: "‚ö†Ô∏è Email sync service not running"
```

### 2. Better Progress Updates

Update `syncProgress` field more frequently during sync:

```typescript
// Every folder sync:
await updateProgress((foldersCompleted / totalFolders) * 100);
```

### 3. Periodic Stuck Sync Check

Background job to auto-recover stuck syncs:

```typescript
// Run every 5 minutes
setInterval(resetStuckSyncs, 5 * 60 * 1000);
```

### 4. One-Command Dev Startup

Add to `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev:full": "concurrently \"npx inngest-cli@latest dev\" \"next dev\""
  }
}
```

## Summary

‚úÖ **Fixed**: Sync timeout logic is now smart and won't kill active syncs  
‚úÖ **Protected**: Added Inngest health checks  
‚úÖ **Improved**: Better error messages and logging  
‚úÖ **Ready**: Your sync can now handle large mailboxes!

**Your sync that was interrupted had already synced ~2,000 emails successfully!** The new sync will continue from where it left off (thanks to delta links).

## File Changes Made

1. ‚úÖ `src/lib/sync/sync-orchestrator.ts` - Smarter timeout logic
2. ‚úÖ `src/lib/inngest/health-check.ts` - Health check function
3. ‚úÖ `src/app/api/inngest/health/route.ts` - Health check API
4. ‚úÖ `src/app/api/email/reset-sync/route.ts` - Manual reset endpoint (already created)

**All fixes are now live!** Just restart your Next.js dev server to apply the changes.
