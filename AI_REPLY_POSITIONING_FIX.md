# ✅ AI REPLY POSITIONING FIX - FINAL

## ❌ **The Problem:**

AI-generated replies were not appearing in the correct position in the composer. They needed to be **above** the quoted text (the "--- On..." line) with 2 blank lines of separation.

---

## 🔧 **Root Cause:**

**Two competing useEffects:**

1. First useEffect loaded the email data (quoted text)
2. Second useEffect tried to add AI reply
3. **Race condition** → Timing issues → Inconsistent results

---

## ✅ **The Solution:**

**Unified the logic into ONE useEffect** that handles both operations in the correct order:

1. ✅ Check localStorage for AI reply FIRST
2. ✅ Fetch the original email data (quoted text)
3. ✅ Combine: `AI reply + \n\n + quoted text`
4. ✅ Set the final body in one operation

---

## 📝 **Code Changes:**

### **File: `src/components/email/EmailComposer.tsx`**

**Before (BROKEN - 2 separate useEffects):**

```typescript
// useEffect 1: Load email data
useEffect(() => {
  if (replyToEmailId) {
    // Load email → set body to quoted text
    setBody(result.data.body);
  }
}, [isOpen, replyToEmailId]);

// useEffect 2: Try to add AI reply (race condition!)
useEffect(() => {
  // Check AI reply → try to prepend to body
  // ❌ But body might not be loaded yet!
}, [isOpen, replyToEmailId, body]);
```

**After (FIXED - single unified useEffect):**

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (replyToEmailId) {
    // 1. Check for AI reply FIRST
    const aiReplyKey = `ai-reply-${replyToEmailId}`;
    const stored = localStorage.getItem(aiReplyKey);
    let aiReplyData = null;

    if (stored) {
      const { reply, subject, timestamp } = JSON.parse(stored);
      if (Date.now() - timestamp < 5 * 60 * 1000) {
        aiReplyData = { reply, subject };
      }
      localStorage.removeItem(aiReplyKey);
    }

    // 2. Fetch email data
    const result = await getEmailForReply(replyToEmailId);

    // 3. Combine AI reply + quoted text
    let finalBody = result.data.body;
    if (aiReplyData) {
      finalBody = `${aiReplyData.reply}\n\n${result.data.body}`;
    }

    // 4. Set everything at once
    setSubject(aiReplyData?.subject || result.data.subject);
    setBody(finalBody);
  }
}, [isOpen, replyToEmailId]);
```
