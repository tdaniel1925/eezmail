# Comprehensive Toast Removal Fix

## Strategy

Instead of trying to fix all the broken syntax, let's:

1. Revert all changes (using git)
2. Do a more targeted removal that only comments out complete toast calls
3. Preserve all other code

## Step 1: Check Git Status

First, let's see what files were changed:

```bash
git status
```

## Step 2: Revert All Changes

```bash
# This will revert ALL uncommitted changes
git checkout .

# OR if you have specific files you want to keep, revert only toast-related files:
git checkout src/components/
git checkout src/app/
```

## Step 3: Better Toast Removal Strategy

Instead of automated scripts, manually identify toast patterns and use a more precise regex:

```powershell
# Only comment out COMPLETE toast calls (with all their closing braces)
# Pattern: toast.success/info/loading/warning followed by complete parentheses

# This is safer than our previous approach
```

## Quick Fix Option

If git revert isn't an option, I can:

1. Go through each file with errors
2. Manually fix the syntax issues
3. Ensure all braces/parentheses are balanced

Would you like me to:
**A)** Help you revert using git and redo the toast removal properly?
**B)** Fix each broken file manually one by one?
**C)** Create a script that only comments COMPLETE toast statements?

Let me know which approach you prefer!
