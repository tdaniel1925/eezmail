## 🚀 **NEW FEATURES ADDED (Session 3)**

### 1. Advanced NLU - Multi-Step Commands (Phase 5)

**The chatbot can now execute complex, multi-step commands!**

**New Files:**
- `src/lib/chat/command-parser.ts` (300 lines)
- `src/app/api/chat/multi-step/route.ts` (200 lines)

**Capabilities:**
```
✅ "Find all emails from John last week and create a summary"
   → Searches emails, then generates summary

✅ "Schedule a meeting with Sarah next Tuesday and invite Mike"
   → Creates event, then adds attendee

✅ "Move all newsletters to a new folder called Reading"
   → Creates folder, then moves emails

✅ "Forward all client emails to my manager and archive them"
   → Forwards emails, then archives

✅ "Search for emails about budget and email the results to finance@company.com"
   → Searches, composes email with results
```

**Technical Features:**
- GPT-4-powered intent parsing
- Dependency graph validation
- Result passing between steps
- AI result aggregation
- Execution time estimation
- Smart command detection heuristics

**How It Works:**
1. Detects multi-step indicators ("and", "then", "also")
2. Parses command into sub-actions with GPT-4
3. Validates dependencies (step 2 can't depend on step 5)
4. Executes actions in order
5. Passes results between dependent steps
6. Aggregates and summarizes final results
