## 📋 Original TODO

Located in `src/components/ai/tabs/ContactActionsTab.tsx` line 132:

### 2. Auto-Start Voice Recording

- Added custom event system (`start-voice-recording`)

### 3. User Experience

- Click "Record Voice Message" → Composer opens
- Recipients automatically filled in
- Voice recording starts immediately

## 💡 Technical Highlights

### Custom Event Pattern

**Problem:** How to trigger action in grandchild component?

**Solution:** Window-level custom events

```typescript
// Trigger (ContactActionsTab)
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('start-voice-recording'));

// Listen (EmailComposer)
window.addEventListener('start-voice-recording', handleStartRecording);
```

**Benefits:**

- Decoupled components
- No prop drilling
- Clean architecture
- Easy to test

### Timing Strategy

**Problem:** Component might not be ready

**Solution:** 500ms delay

```typescript
setTimeout(() => {
  window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('start-voice-recording'));
}, 500);
```

**Why 500ms?**

- EmailComposer modal animation: ~300ms
- Component mount + ref initialization: ~100ms
- Safety buffer: ~100ms
- Total: 500ms (safe and fast)

### State Management

**Two Modes:**

- `'email'` → Normal composition
- `'voice'` → Auto-start recording

```typescript
const [composerMode, setComposerMode] = useState<'email' | 'voice'>('email');
```

Benefits:

- Clear intent
- Reusable pattern
- Easy to extend (e.g., `'scheduled'`, `'template'`)
