#### 3. Enhanced FAQs (EXPANDED)

**Original**: 8 basic FAQs  
**Enhanced**: 30+ comprehensive FAQs with examples

**Sample Enhanced FAQ**:
```
Q: What's the difference between Imbox, Feed, and Paper Trail?
================================================================

A: This is inspired by Hey.com's three-tier system. Here's how it works:

**Imbox** (Important Inbox)
- What: Emails from VIPs and people you actually want to hear from
- Who decides: You (by screening) or AI (in Hey Mode)
- Examples:
  • Your boss: "Can we talk about the Q3 budget?"
  • Client: "Loved your proposal, let's move forward"
  • Family: "Happy birthday!"
- Notifications: ✅ Yes (desktop + sound)

**Feed** (The Feed)
- What: Updates and newsletters you want, but can read in batches
- Who decides: AI detects bulk/marketing emails
- Examples:
  • Morning Brew daily newsletter
  • GitHub notifications
  • LinkedIn: "Someone viewed your profile"
  • Product Hunt: "Top 10 products today"
- Notifications: ❌ No (read when you want)

**Paper Trail** (The Paper Trail)
- What: Transactional emails you need to keep, but never read
- Who decides: AI detects receipts, confirmations, automated messages
- Examples:
  • Amazon: "Your order has shipped"
  • Bank: "Your statement is ready"
  • Uber: "Receipt for your trip"
  • Domain registrar: "Auto-renewal confirmation"
- Notifications: ❌ No (searchable archive)

**How to Use This System**:

Traditional User (No Screening):
1. All emails go to Inbox initially
2. You manually move to folders
3. Works like Gmail/Outlook

Hey Mode User (AI Screening):
1. AI automatically sorts incoming email
2. First-time senders go to "Screener"
3. You approve once: "Imbox", "Feed", or "Paper Trail"
4. Future emails from that sender automatically go to chosen location
5. No more inbox clutter!

Hybrid User (Best of Both):
1. AI suggests sorting
2. You confirm or override
3. Full control + AI assistance

**Pro Tip**: Start with Traditional mode for 1 week to understand your
email patterns. Then switch to Hey Mode and let AI learn from your
behavior. Accuracy improves over time.

**Visual Breakdown**:
```
Imbox (10-20 emails/day)
  ├─ Boss
  ├─ Direct reports
  ├─ Key clients
  └─ Family/friends

Feed (50-100 emails/day)
  ├─ Newsletters
  ├─ Social media updates
  ├─ Non-critical notifications
  └─ Bulk updates

Paper Trail (30-50 emails/day)
  ├─ Receipts
  ├─ Confirmations
  ├─ Shipping notifications
  └─ Automated reports
```
```

**Sample Troubleshooting Entry**:
```
Issue: Gmail Sync Stuck at "Syncing... 45%"
=========================================

Symptoms:
- Progress bar frozen
- No new emails appearing
- Sync started 10+ minutes ago

Root Causes (in order of likelihood):
1. Rate limiting (Gmail API quota)
2. Large attachment blocking sync
3. Folder with 10,000+ emails
4. Network interruption
5. OAuth token expired

Solutions:

🔧 Solution 1: Wait for Rate Limit Reset (Most Common)
------------------------------------------------------
Gmail API limit: 250 quota units/user/second

What to do:
1. Wait 5 minutes
2. Sync will auto-resume
3. Check Settings → Email Accounts → Sync Status

Why it happens:
- Initial sync of large mailbox (10,000+ emails)
- Gmail throttles to protect their servers
- Normal behavior, not a bug

Prevention:
- Let initial sync run overnight
- Don't manually re-sync during initial sync

🔧 Solution 2: Skip Large Attachments
--------------------------------------
If sync stuck on specific email with 50MB+ attachment:

1. Go to Settings → Email Accounts
2. Click account → "Sync Options"
3. Enable "Skip attachments over 25MB"
4. Click "Retry Sync"

Result: Sync completes, you can download large attachments on-demand later

🔧 Solution 3: Exclude Problem Folder
--------------------------------------
If sync stuck on a specific folder (e.g., "All Mail" with 50,000 emails):

1. Go to Settings → Email Accounts
2. Click "Folder Settings"
3. Uncheck the problem folder
4. Click "Save & Sync"
5. Sync will skip that folder

You can re-enable it later after main folders sync

🔧 Solution 4: Reconnect Account
---------------------------------
If OAuth token expired:

1. Settings → Email Accounts
2. Click "Reconnect" next to Gmail account
3. Confirm removal
4. Sign in again
5. Fresh sync starts
