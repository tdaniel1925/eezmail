# Contacts Feature Review - Critical Issues Found

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES DISCOVERED

### Issue 1: Contact Email/Phone Field Access Error
**Location**: `src/lib/contacts/communication-actions.ts` (lines 46, 91)

**Problem**: Code is trying to access `contact.email` and `contact.phone` directly, but these fields don't exist in the contacts table. Contacts uses separate tables:
- `contactEmails` table for emails
- `contactPhones` table for phones

**Current Broken Code**:
```typescript
const email = contact.email || ''; // ‚ùå contact.email doesn't exist!
const phone = contact.phone || ''; // ‚ùå contact.phone doesn't exist!
```

**Impact**: 
- SMS functionality completely broken
- Email composition from contacts broken  
- Cannot retrieve contact communication info

### Issue 2: Missing Drizzle Relations
**Location**: `src/db/schema.ts`

**Problem**: No Drizzle relations defined for contacts to fetch related data (emails, phones, addresses, notes, timeline) in one query.

**Impact**:
- Cannot easily fetch contact with related data
- Requires multiple queries instead of one
- Performance issues

### Issue 3: Import/Export May Have Same Issue
**Location**: `src/lib/contacts/import-export.ts`

**Problem**: Likely has same field access issues.

## ‚úÖ WHAT'S WORKING WELL

1. **Contact Notes**:
   - ‚úÖ Proper timestamps (createdAt, updatedAt)
   - ‚úÖ CRUD operations complete
   - ‚úÖ Security checks in place

2. **Contact Timeline**:
   - ‚úÖ Event tracking with timestamps
   - ‚úÖ Metadata storage for rich events
   - ‚úÖ Proper indexing

3. **Database Schema**:
   - ‚úÖ Well-structured normalized design
   - ‚úÖ Proper foreign keys and cascade deletes
   - ‚úÖ Good indexing strategy

4. **Validation**:
   - ‚úÖ Zod schemas (just fixed null issue)
   - ‚úÖ Input sanitization
   - ‚úÖ Type safety

## üîß FIXES NEEDED

1. Add Drizzle relations to schema
2. Fix communication-actions.ts to properly fetch emails/phones
3. Verify import-export.ts doesn't have same issues
4. Test end-to-end contact workflows
