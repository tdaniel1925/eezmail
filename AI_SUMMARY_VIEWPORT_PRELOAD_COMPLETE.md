# AI Summary Viewport Preloading - Complete! 🚀

## What Was Wrong

AI summaries were loading **on mouseover**, causing a 1-3 second delay **every time** you hovered over an email. This felt slow and frustrating.

## What Was Fixed

### ✅ Implemented Viewport-Based Preloading

AI summaries now load **automatically** for emails **in the viewport** (visible on screen) - **before** you even hover!

### How It Works:

1. **Intersection Observer** watches which emails are visible
2. **Automatic batch fetching** of AI summaries for visible emails
3. **Smart throttling** (3 summaries at a time) to avoid overwhelming the API
4. **200px lookahead** - starts loading summaries 200px before emails enter viewport
5. **Instant display** - summaries are ready when you hover!

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Created New Hook: `src/hooks/useViewportSummaries.ts`

This hook provides:

- **Viewport detection** using Intersection Observer
- **Batch summary fetching** (3 at a time)
- **Caching** to avoid re-fetching
- **Smart registration** of email elements for observation

**Key Features:**

```typescript
const { getSummary, registerEmailElement } = useViewportSummaries(
  displayEmails,
  scrollContainerRef
);
```

### 2. ✅ Updated `src/components/email/EmailList.tsx`

- Added `useViewportSummaries` hook
- Registered email elements for viewport tracking
- Passes preloaded summaries to `ExpandableEmailItem`

**Before:**

```tsx
<ExpandableEmailItem
  email={email}
  // ... other props
/>
```

**After:**

```tsx
<div
  data-email-id={email.id}
  ref={(el) => {
    emailRefs.current[email.id] = el;
    registerEmailElement(email.id, el); // ✅ Track viewport
  }}
>
  <ExpandableEmailItem
    email={email}
    preloadedSummary={getSummary(email.id)} // ✅ Pass preloaded summary
    // ... other props
  />
</div>
```

### 3. ✅ Updated `src/components/email/ExpandableEmailItem.tsx`

- Accepts `preloadedSummary` prop
- Uses preloaded summary if available
- Falls back to on-demand fetching if needed

**Before:**

- Summary loaded **only on mouseover**
- 1-3 second delay **every time**

**After:**

- Summary **preloaded in background**
- **Instant** display on mouseover
- No more waiting!

## Performance Improvements

| Feature               | Before              | After                           |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **First hover**       | 🕐 1-3 seconds      | ⚡ **Instant** (already loaded) |
| **Subsequent hovers** | ⚡ Instant (cached) | ⚡ **Instant** (cached)         |
| **Scrolling**         | ❌ No preload       | ✅ **Auto-preload**             |
| **API calls**         | 1 per hover         | 🎯 **Batched** (3 at a time)    |
| **Network usage**     | High (reactive)     | ✅ **Optimized** (proactive)    |

## How to Test

### 1. **Restart Next.js Server**

```powershell
cd C:\dev\win-email_client
npm run dev
```

### 2. **Open Inbox**

Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/dashboard/inbox

### 3. **Watch Console**

Open browser console (F12) and watch for:

```
✅ Preloading summaries for visible emails...
```

### 4. **Hover Over Emails**

- **First visible emails**: Summaries appear **instantly** ⚡
- **Scroll down**: New emails auto-load summaries
- **Hover after scrolling**: **Instant** - already loaded!

---

## Technical Details

### Batch Processing:

- **3 summaries at a time** to avoid rate limiting
- **100ms delay between batches** for smooth loading
- **Smart queueing** prevents duplicate requests

### Viewport Detection:

- **200px rootMargin** - starts loading before entering screen
- **10% threshold** - triggers when 10% of email is visible
- **Automatic cleanup** when emails leave viewport

### Caching:

- Summaries cached in memory
- **No re-fetching** of already loaded summaries
- **Persistent across hovers**
