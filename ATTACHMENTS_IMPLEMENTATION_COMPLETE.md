## üóÇÔ∏è Files Created

### 1. Database Migration

- **`migrations/add-attachment-fields.sql`**
  - Adds all new fields to `email_attachments` table
  - Creates indexes for performance
  - Run this in Supabase SQL editor

### 2. Core Service

- **`src/lib/email/attachment-service.ts`**
  - Main attachment processing service
  - On-demand download strategy
  - Provider-specific download handlers (Gmail, Microsoft Graph, IMAP)
  - Upload to Supabase Storage
  - Metadata management

### 3. API Routes

- **`src/app/api/attachments/[attachmentId]/download/route.ts`**
  - Download attachments with on-demand fetching
  - Checks if already downloaded
  - Falls back to provider if needed
- **`src/app/api/attachments/[attachmentId]/route.ts`**
  - DELETE endpoint for removing attachments

## üìù Files Modified

### 1. Database Schema

**`src/db/schema.ts`**

- Added fields to `emailAttachments` table:
  - `accountId` - Link to email account
  - `userId` - Link to user for RLS
  - `originalFilename` - Preserve original name
  - `downloadStatus` - Track download state ('pending', 'downloading', 'completed', 'failed')
  - `emailSubject`, `emailFrom`, `emailReceivedAt` - Context for search
  - `extractedText`, `tags` - Search/organization
  - `isScanned`, `isSafe`, `scanResult` - Security
  - `updatedAt` - Last update timestamp
- Added indexes for performance

### 2. Email Sync Service

**`src/lib/sync/email-sync-service.ts`**

- **IMAP Sync** (line 1388-1407): Process attachments after email insert
- **Gmail Sync** (line 1117-1136): Process attachments after email insert
- **Microsoft Graph Sync** (line 690-709): Process attachments after email insert
- All sync functions now call `AttachmentService.processEmailAttachments()`

### 3. IMAP Service

**`src/lib/email/imap-service.ts`**

- Updated `ImapMessage` interface to include `attachments` array
- Modified message parsing to extract and include attachment data
- Attachments now include: filename, contentType, size, content, contentId, contentDisposition

### 4. Email Sending

**`src/lib/email/send-email.ts`**

- Updated `saveSentEmail()` function
- Now saves attachments to storage after sending
- Calls `AttachmentService.uploadAndSave()` for each attachment
- Converts base64 to Buffer before upload

### 5. Email Viewer UI

**`src/components/email/EmailViewer.tsx`**

- Added state for attachments, loading, and download progress
- Fetch attachments when email changes
- `handleDownloadAttachment()` function with progress tracking
- `formatFileSize()` helper for display
- Updated attachments section to show real data
- Download buttons with loading states

### 6. Attachments Page

**`src/app/dashboard/attachments/page.tsx`**

- Implemented `handleDownload()` with actual API calls
- Implemented `handleDelete()` with confirmation
- Both functions use toast notifications for feedback
- Blob download with automatic file save

## üîÑ How It Works

### Incoming Emails (Sync)

1. **Email Sync Detects Attachment**
   - IMAP: `mailparser` provides full attachment data
   - Gmail: Detects via `payload.parts[].body.attachmentId`
   - Microsoft Graph: Detects via `message.hasAttachments`

2. **Save Metadata Only**
   - `AttachmentService.processEmailAttachments()` called
   - Extracts metadata (filename, size, type)
   - Saves to `email_attachments` table
   - `downloadStatus: 'pending'`
   - **No file download yet** (performance optimization)

3. **User Clicks Download**
   - UI calls `/api/attachments/[attachmentId]/download`
   - API checks if already downloaded
   - If not: `AttachmentService.downloadAndStore()`
   - Downloads from provider's API
   - Uploads to Supabase Storage
   - Updates `downloadStatus: 'completed'`
   - Streams file to user

4. **Subsequent Downloads**
   - Already has `storageUrl` and `downloadStatus: 'completed'`
   - Fetches directly from Supabase Storage
   - No need to call provider again

### Outgoing Emails (Sending)

1. **User Composes Email with Attachments**
   - Attachments uploaded to temporary state
   - Sent via SMTP with attachments

2. **Email Sent Successfully**
   - `saveSentEmail()` saves email to database
   - Loops through `params.attachments`
   - Calls `AttachmentService.uploadAndSave()` for each
   - Uploads to Supabase Storage
   - Saves to `email_attachments` table
   - `downloadStatus: 'completed'` (already have file)

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema Changes

```sql
-- New fields in email_attachments table
account_id UUID NOT NULL          -- FK to email_accounts
user_id UUID NOT NULL             -- FK for RLS
original_filename TEXT NOT NULL   -- Preserve original name
download_status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending'  -- pending/downloading/completed/failed
email_subject TEXT                -- For search
email_from TEXT                   -- For search
email_received_at TIMESTAMP       -- For search
extracted_text TEXT               -- PDF text extraction (future)
tags TEXT[]                       -- User tags
is_scanned BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE  -- Virus scan (future)
is_safe BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE      -- Scan result
scan_result TEXT                  -- Scan details
updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()

-- Indexes
CREATE INDEX email_attachments_user_id_idx ON email_attachments(user_id);
CREATE INDEX email_attachments_account_id_idx ON email_attachments(account_id);
CREATE INDEX email_attachments_email_received_at_idx ON email_attachments(email_received_at DESC);
```

## üì¶ Storage Structure

```
email-attachments/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ attachments/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {userId}/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sent/                    # Outgoing email attachments
‚îÇ       ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 1705123456789-document.pdf
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025/                    # Incoming email attachments (by date)
‚îÇ           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01/

## üîí Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)

```sql
-- Users can only access their own attachments
CREATE POLICY "Users can read their own attachments"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (
  bucket_id = 'email-attachments'
  AND (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text
);
```

### Private Bucket

- Attachments bucket is **private** (not public)
- All access requires authentication
- Files only accessible via authenticated API routes

### User-Scoped Data

- `userId` field in every attachment record
- RLS ensures users can only see their own files
- File paths include `userId` for extra security

---

## üöÄ Next Steps (User Action Required)

### 1. Run Database Migration

```sql
-- Copy contents of migrations/add-attachment-fields.sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
```

### 2. Create Storage Bucket

```sql
-- In Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Create bucket
-- OR run this SQL:
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('email-attachments', 'email-attachments', false);
```

### 3. Add RLS Policies

```sql
-- Copy policies from SUPABASE_STORAGE_SETUP.md
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
```

### 4. Restart Dev Server

```bash
# Kill existing processes
Get-Process -Name node -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force

# Clear Next.js cache
Remove-Item -Path .next -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Start fresh
npm run dev
```
