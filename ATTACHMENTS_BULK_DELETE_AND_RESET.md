---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management:

```typescript
const [selectedIds, setSelectedIds] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());
const [isResetting, setIsResetting] = useState(false);
```

### Bulk Delete Flow:

1. User selects attachments → IDs added to `selectedIds` Set
2. Click "Delete Selected" → confirmation dialog
3. `Promise.allSettled` for parallel deletion (all at once)
4. Results tracked (successes vs failures)
5. UI updated, selection cleared
6. Toast shows result summary

### Reset Flow:

1. User clicks "Reset" → confirmation dialog
2. POST to `/api/attachments/reset`
3. Server deletes all user's attachment records
4. Returns count of deleted records
5. Client clears local state
6. Toast shows success + auto-refresh in 3 seconds
7. Background sync automatically re-processes attachments

### Selection Logic:

```typescript
// Toggle individual item
const toggleSelection = (id: string) => {
  const newSelected = new Set(selectedIds);
  if (newSelected.has(id)) {
    newSelected.delete(id);
  } else {
    newSelected.add(id);
  }
  setSelectedIds(newSelected);
};

// Toggle all visible items
const toggleSelectAll = () => {
  if (selectedIds.size === filteredAttachments.length) {
    setSelectedIds(new Set()); // Deselect all
  } else {
    setSelectedIds(new Set(filteredAttachments.map((a) => a.id))); // Select all
  }
};
```

## 🔒 Security

### Reset Endpoint:

- ✅ Requires authentication (Supabase user session)
- ✅ User-scoped queries (only deletes own attachments)
- ✅ Returns count of deleted records (transparency)
- ✅ Does NOT delete files from storage (keeps data safe)

### Bulk Delete:

- ✅ Individual deletion API calls (uses existing DELETE endpoint)
- ✅ Each request requires auth
- ✅ User can only delete own attachments (enforced by API)

---

## 📊 API Endpoints

**Purpose:** Delete all attachment metadata for current user

**Request:**

- No body required
- Requires auth header

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,

}
```

**What it does:**

1. Authenticates user
2. Finds all user's email accounts
3. Gets all attachments for those accounts
