## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Notes

### Email Composer Design

- Use modal overlay (like Gmail)
- Support minimized mode (compose while viewing emails)
- Auto-save to drafts every 30 seconds
- Use `react-hook-form` + `zod` for validation
- Rich text editor: TipTap or similar

### Keyboard Shortcuts Implementation

- Use `react-hotkeys-hook` or custom hook
- Don't conflict with browser shortcuts
- Respect input focus (disable in text fields)
- Show shortcuts in tooltips

### Command Palette

- Use `cmdk` library (same as Vercel, Linear, GitHub)
- Fuzzy search with `fuse.js`
- Group actions by category
- Show recent actions first

### Mobile Navigation

- Use `@radix-ui/react-navigation-menu` for mobile
- Bottom navigation for primary actions
- Drawer for sidebar on mobile
- Swipe gestures with `react-swipeable`

---

## üé® Design Consistency

All new features should match:

- Glassmorphic design system
- Light/dark mode support
- Primary color: `#FF4C5A`
- Backdrop blur and transparency
- Smooth transitions
- Consistent spacing
