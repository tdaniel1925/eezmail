## Still Having Issues?

If you still get errors after adding all the keys:

1. **Check the Nylas Dashboard Callback URL:**
   - Go to Nylas Dashboard ‚Üí OAuth Settings
   - Add callback URL: `http://localhost:3000/api/nylas/callback`
   - For production: `https://yourdomain.com/api/nylas/callback`

2. **Check that keys are correct:**
   - No extra spaces
   - No quotes around values
   - API Key starts with `nylas_`

3. **Restart the server:**

   ```bash
   # Kill the server
   Stop-Process -Name node -Force

   # Start again
   npm run dev
   ```

## Why Are These Keys Needed?

- **`NYLAS_API_KEY`**: Authenticates your app with Nylas API
- **`NYLAS_API_URI`**: Tells the SDK which region to connect to
- **`NYLAS_CLIENT_SECRET`**: Used to exchange OAuth codes for access tokens
- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_NYLAS_CLIENT_ID`**: Your app's public identifier (already set)

Without these, the Nylas SDK cannot initialize or generate OAuth URLs.

**Once you add these keys, the 404 error will be resolved! üéâ**
