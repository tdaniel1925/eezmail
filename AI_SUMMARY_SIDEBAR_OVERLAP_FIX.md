# ✅ AI Summary Popup - Sidebar Overlap Fix

## Issue Fixed
Popup was going under the AI assistant sidebar and getting cut off.

## Solution: Two Changes

### 1. Increased Z-Index
**Changed:** `zIndex: 9999` → `zIndex: 99999`

This ensures the popup appears **above everything**, including:
- AI assistant sidebar
- Modals
- Overlays
- Other UI elements

### 2. Smart Sidebar Detection
Added logic to detect when popup would overlap with AI sidebar and automatically show on left of cursor instead.

```typescript
const aiSidebarWidth = 380; // AI sidebar width when expanded
const rightEdgeOfPopup = finalLeft + popupWidth;
const aiSidebarStartsAt = viewportWidth - aiSidebarWidth;

// If popup would overlap with AI sidebar, show on left of cursor
if (rightEdgeOfPopup > aiSidebarStartsAt - 20) {
  finalLeft = mouseX - popupWidth - 15;
}
```

## How It Works

### Scenario 1: Cursor Far from Sidebar
- Popup appears **15px to right** of cursor ✅
- No overlap with AI sidebar
- Normal behavior

### Scenario 2: Cursor Near AI Sidebar
- Detects popup would overlap sidebar
- **Automatically switches to left side** of cursor
- Popup appears 15px to **left** instead
- No overlap! ✅

### Scenario 3: Cursor Very Close to Sidebar
- Even if showing on left, popup visible
- Z-index 99999 ensures it's **on top** if there is overlap
- Never gets cut off ✅

## Console Output

You'll now see this when near the sidebar:
```
🎯 Popup Calculation: {
  cursor: { x: 1400, y: 300 },
  initialLeft: 1415,
  viewport: { width: 1920, height: 1080 }
}
📍 Adjusted left (would overlap AI sidebar, showing on left): 1065
✅ Final Position: { top: 200, left: 1065 }
```

## File Modified
**`src/components/email/ExpandableEmailItem.tsx`**

### Changes:
1. ✅ Z-index: `9999` → `99999`
2. ✅ AI sidebar detection: `aiSidebarWidth = 380px`
3. ✅ Smart positioning: Shows on left when would overlap

## Testing

Hover over emails at different positions:

- [ ] **Far left**: Popup on right ✅
- [ ] **Middle**: Popup on right ✅
- [ ] **Near AI sidebar**: Popup switches to left ✅
- [ ] **Very close to sidebar**: Popup on top, fully visible ✅

## Result

✅ Popup **always fully visible**  
✅ **Never goes under** AI sidebar  
✅ **Automatically adapts** position  
✅ **Z-index 99999** ensures it's on top
