## 🎯 Success Metrics

**Lines of Code Added**: ~3,500
**Components Created**: 7
**Server Actions**: 10
**API Routes**: 4
**Database Tables**: 4
**Enums**: 6
**Views**: 3 (Month, Week, Day)
**External Integrations**: 2 (Google, Microsoft)

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Quick Create**: Click any date in month view or time slot in week/day view to create event instantly

2. **Recurring Patterns**: Use weekdays pattern for daily standups (Mon-Fri only)

3. **Color Coding**: Assign colors by type (blue=meetings, green=personal, red=urgent)

4. **Email Context**: Events created from emails show the full email thread when clicked

5. **Sync Strategy**: Set up both Google and Microsoft for full coverage

6. **Current Time**: Day view shows red line for "now" - great for staying on schedule

7. **RRULE**: For complex patterns, edit the RRULE string directly (advanced users)

---

## 🚨 Known Limitations

1. **Webhook Real-time Sync**: Not implemented (would require webhook endpoints and subscriptions)
2. **Exception Dates**: Recurring events don't yet support exception dates (edit series only)
3. **All-day Events**: Supported in database, but UI treats as midnight-to-midnight
4. **Timezone Display**: Events show in UTC, not local timezone (coming soon)
5. **Conflict Detection**: No visual warning for overlapping events yet

---
