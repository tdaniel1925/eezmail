# Sandbox Company Workflow - Complete Friction Removal Guide

## 🎯 Overview

We've completely overhauled the sandbox company management system to eliminate friction points and provide a seamless experience from company creation through user onboarding and management.

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. Modal Syntax Error (CRITICAL FIX)

**Status**: ✅ Fixed

**Problem**: The CreateSandboxCompanyModal had a compilation error preventing the admin dashboard from loading.

**Solution**: Completely rewrote the modal component with improved structure and error handling.

---

## 🚀 Major Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Company Creation Form

**File**: `src/components/admin/CreateSandboxCompanyModal.tsx`

#### New Features:

- ✅ **Collapsible Sections**: Twilio and OpenAI credentials now collapse to reduce visual clutter
- ✅ **Better Help Text**: Info boxes explain what each section is for
- ✅ **Placeholder Text**: Examples in all input fields guide users
- ✅ **Loading States**: Clear feedback during submission
- ✅ **Improved Validation**: Better error messages
- ✅ **Sticky Header**: Header stays visible when scrolling long forms

#### UX Improvements:

```typescript
// Before: All fields always visible (overwhelming)
// After: Optional sections collapse by default

[showTwilioSection state]  // User clicks to expand only if needed
[showOpenAISection state]  // Credentials hidden until needed
```

#### Visual Enhancements:

- Descriptive subtitle explaining purpose
- Optional badges on collapsible sections
- Color-coded info boxes (blue for info, yellow for warnings)
- Better button states showing "Creating..." during submission

### 2. Comprehensive Company Detail Page

**File**: `src/app/admin/companies/[id]/page.tsx`  
**Component**: `src/components/admin/SandboxCompanyDetail.tsx`

#### Features Implemented:

**Tab-Based Interface**:

1. **Overview Tab**:
   - Company information (editable inline)
   - Contact details
   - Service credentials status
   - Quick stats dashboard

2. **Users Tab**:
   - List all assigned users
   - Add users with dropdown selector
   - Remove users with one click
   - Shows user assignment history

3. **Usage Tab**:
   - SMS messages sent
   - AI tokens consumed
   - Storage used
   - Visual indicators for unlimited quotas

4. **Settings Tab**:
   - Internal notes management
   - Danger zone (suspend/delete actions)
   - Future: credential management

#### Inline Editing:

```typescript
// Edit mode toggle - no separate forms!
[Edit Button] → Edit fields inline → [Save/Cancel]
```

---

### 3. User Assignment System

**New API Endpoints Created**:

#### A. List Company Users

```
GET /api/admin/sandbox-companies/[id]/users
```

Returns all users assigned to a specific company.

#### B. Assign User to Company

```
POST /api/admin/sandbox-companies/[id]/users
Body: { userId: "uuid" }
```

Assigns a sandbox user to the company.

#### C. Remove User from Company

```
DELETE /api/admin/sandbox-companies/[id]/users/[userId]
```

Removes user assignment (doesn't delete user).

#### D. Update Company

```
PUT /api/admin/sandbox-companies/[id]
Body: { name, description, contactName, etc. }
```

Updates company details with audit logging.

#### E. Delete Company

```
DELETE /api/admin/sandbox-companies/[id]
```

Removes company entirely (with confirmation).
