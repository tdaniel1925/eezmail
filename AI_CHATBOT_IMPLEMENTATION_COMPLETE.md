## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Move Emails by Sender

**User**: "Move all emails from Doug Johnson to a Doug Johnson folder"
**Chatbot**: "I'll create a 'Doug Johnson' folder and move 23 emails from doug.johnson@example.com into it. Proceed?"
**User**: "yes"
**Chatbot**: "✅ Created 'Doug Johnson' folder and moved 23 emails! (Say 'undo' to reverse)"

### Example 2: Calendar Management

**User**: "Schedule a meeting with Sarah tomorrow at 2pm for 1 hour"
**Chatbot**: "I'll create a calendar event 'Meeting with Sarah' for tomorrow at 2:00 PM lasting 1 hour. Should I proceed?"
**User**: "yes"
**Chatbot**: "✅ Calendar event would be created for [date]. Full calendar integration coming soon!"

### Example 3: Email Research

**User**: "What did John say about the project deadline?"
**Chatbot**: "Based on 3 emails from John Smith:

In his email from October 10, John mentioned the project deadline is October 31st. He emphasized that all deliverables need to be completed by October 28th to allow time for review.

In a follow-up on October 12, he clarified that the design phase should be done by October 20th.

Sources:
• John Smith - Project Timeline Update
• John Smith - Deadline Clarification
• John Smith - Design Phase Schedule"

### Example 4: Voice Dictation

**User**: [Clicks Dictate button, speaks] "Hi Sarah, I wanted to follow up on our discussion about the project timeline..."
**Composer**: [Transcribes in real-time]
**User**: [Clicks Stop, then Remix]
**Composer**: Polishes the dictated text into professional email

## Known Limitations

1. **Calendar Integration**: Placeholder implementation ready for full calendar backend
2. **Attachment Analysis**: Framework ready, needs document parsing libraries (pdf-parse, mammoth)
3. **Pre-existing TypeScript Errors**: 132 errors remain in other parts of the codebase (not related to AI chatbot)
4. **Voice Input**: Requires browser support (Chrome, Edge, Safari)

---

## Next Steps for Full Functionality

1. **Connect Calendar Backend**: Integrate with actual calendar API (Nylas/Google/Microsoft)
2. **Add Document Parsing**: Install and integrate pdf-parse, mammoth for full attachment analysis
3. **Test End-to-End**: Test all chatbot commands in production environment
4. **Fine-tune Prompts**: Adjust system prompt based on real usage patterns
5. **Add More Functions**: Expand to settings, theme changes, etc. if desired
