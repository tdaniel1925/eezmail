Step 1: Connect Email     ✅ Tracked
Step 2: Create Signature  ❌ Not tracked (broken)
Step 3: Try AI Reply      ❌ Not tracked (missing)

Working: 1/3 steps (33%)
```

### AFTER:

Step 1: Connect Email     ✅ Tracked (OAuth callback)
Step 2: Create Signature  ✅ Tracked (signature actions)
Step 3: Try AI Reply      ✅ Tracked (AI reply APIs) ← JUST FIXED!

Working: 3/3 steps (100%) ✨
```

## 🔧 What Was Added

### File 1: `src/app/api/ai/generate-reply/route.ts`

**Lines 402-409:** Added onboarding hook

```typescript
// ✅ Update onboarding progress (AI reply tried)
try {
  const { updateOnboardingProgress } = await import('@/lib/onboarding/actions');
  await updateOnboardingProgress(user.id, { aiReplyTried: true });
} catch (error) {

}
```

### File 2: `src/app/api/ai/reply/route.ts`

**Lines 157-164:** Added onboarding hook

```typescript
// ✅ Update onboarding progress (AI reply tried)
try {
  const { updateOnboardingProgress } = await import('@/lib/onboarding/actions');
  await updateOnboardingProgress(user.id, { aiReplyTried: true });
} catch (error) {
  console.log('Onboarding update skipped:', error);
}
```

## 🎯 User Experience

### When onboarding tracking triggers:

1. **User clicks AI Reply** (any of these):
   - "Professional Reply" button
   - "Acknowledge" button
   - "Detailed Reply" button
   - "Custom Reply" button
   - AI reply from email viewer
   - AI reply from chatbot

2. **AI generates reply successfully**

3. **Database updates** `onboarding_progress.ai_reply_tried = true`

4. **UI updates instantly**:
   - ✅ Banner: "3/3 Complete"
   - ✅ Checklist: AI Reply step gets checkmark
   - ✅ Sidebar: 100% progress bar
   - ✅ Onboarding page: All steps complete

## ✨ Complete Onboarding Flow

### Step 1: Email Connection ✅

**Trigger:** OAuth callback completes
**File:** `src/app/api/auth/microsoft/callback/route.ts`
**Status:** Always worked

### Step 2: Signature Creation ✅

**Trigger:** User creates or updates signature
**File:** `src/lib/settings/signature-actions.ts`
**Status:** Fixed in previous update

### Step 3: AI Reply Generation ✅

**Trigger:** User generates AI reply (any method)
**Files:**

- `src/app/api/ai/generate-reply/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/ai/reply/route.ts`
  **Status:** Fixed in this update ← **YOU ARE HERE**

---

## 🛡️ Fail-Safe Design

The hook uses try/catch to ensure it never breaks the AI reply feature:

```typescript
try {
  // Update onboarding
} catch (error) {
  // Log and continue - AI reply still works!
  console.log('Onboarding update skipped:', error);
}
```

**Why this matters:**

- AI reply is a **core feature** - must always work
- Onboarding is **nice-to-have** - shouldn't block core features
- If onboarding system fails, AI reply continues normally
