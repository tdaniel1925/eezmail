## Database Schema

Uses existing `emailAttachments` table from `src/db/schema.ts`:

```typescript
{
  id: uuid
  emailId: uuid (FK ‚Üí emails)
  providerAttachmentId: text
  contentId: text
  filename: varchar(255)
  contentType: varchar(100)
  size: integer
  storageUrl: text
  storageKey: text
  isInline: boolean
  downloadCount: integer
  lastDownloadedAt: timestamp
  createdAt: timestamp
}
```

## User Workflow

### Viewing Attachments

1. Click "Attachments" in sidebar or use Command Palette (`‚åòK` ‚Üí "Attachments")
2. Browse all attachments in Grid or Table view
3. Use search and filters to find specific files
4. Sort by date, name, size, or type

### AI-Powered Analysis

1. Click any attachment to open preview
2. AI automatically generates content summary
3. View summary in right sidebar
4. See file details and metadata
5. Quick download or open in new tab

### File Actions

- **Download**: Single click download button
- **Delete**: Remove attachment with confirmation
- **Preview**: View supported file types inline
- **Open**: External tab for full experience

## AI Integration

When an attachment is clicked:

1. **Modal Opens**: Preview displays with loading state
2. **AI Analysis**: API call to `/api/ai/attachment-summary`
3. **Summary Generation**: GPT-4 analyzes filename and type
4. **Display**: Summary appears in modal sidebar
5. **Fallback**: Error handling if AI unavailable

### Example AI Summary

For `Q4_Marketing_Strategy.pdf`:

> "This document likely contains the marketing strategy plan for the fourth quarter, including campaign goals, target audiences, budget allocations, and performance metrics for the upcoming quarter's marketing initiatives."
