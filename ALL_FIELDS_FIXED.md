# ✅ ALL DATABASE CONSTRAINT ERRORS FIXED

## 🐛 The Problem

The sync was fetching emails from Microsoft Graph API successfully, but **every email insert was failing** due to missing required database fields:

1. ❌ `message_id` was NULL → **FIXED**
2. ❌ `to_addresses` was NULL → **FIXED**
3. ❌ `cc_addresses` was NULL → **FIXED**
4. ❌ `bcc_addresses` was NULL → **FIXED**

---

## ✅ The Solution

### **Updated Graph API $select:**

Added `toRecipients`, `ccRecipients`, `bccRecipients`, and `internetMessageId`

### **Updated Email Insert:**

```typescript
{
  messageId: message.internetMessageId || message.id,
  toAddresses: message.toRecipients?.map(r => ({
    name: r.emailAddress?.name || '',
    email: r.emailAddress?.address || ''
  })) || [],
  ccAddresses: message.ccRecipients?.map(r => ({
    name: r.emailAddress?.name || '',
    email: r.emailAddress?.address || ''
  })) || [],
  bccAddresses: message.bccRecipients?.map(r => ({
    name: r.emailAddress?.name || '',
    email: r.emailAddress?.address || ''
  })) || []
}
```
