# Reply Email Formatting Fix

## Issue

When clicking "Reply" on an email, the composer window showed either:

- Empty body (if no AI content)
- Raw AI content only
- No properly formatted original email

The original email should be quoted below the reply area, like standard email clients (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)

## Screenshot Reference

User showed composer with raw, unformatted email content:

Should look like:

## Fix Applied

**File:** `src/components/email/EmailViewer.tsx`

**Lines 775-779** - Updated reply body formatting:

### Before:

```typescript
body:
  composerMode === 'forward'
    ? `\n\n------- Forwarded message -------\nFrom: ${email.fromAddress.email}\nDate: ${format(new Date(email.receivedAt), 'MMM d, yyyy h:mm a')}\nSubject: ${email.subject}\n\n${email.bodyText}`
    : aiReplyContent || '', // Empty if no AI content
```

### After:

```typescript
body:
  composerMode === 'forward'
    ? `\n\n------- Forwarded message -------\nFrom: ${email.fromAddress.email}\nDate: ${format(new Date(email.receivedAt), 'MMM d, yyyy h:mm a')}\nSubject: ${email.subject}\n\n${email.bodyText}`
    : aiReplyContent ||
      `\n\n---\nOn ${format(new Date(email.receivedAt), 'MMM d, yyyy \'at\' h:mm a')}, ${email.fromAddress.name || email.fromAddress.email} wrote:\n\n${email.bodyText ? email.bodyText.split('\n').map(line => `> ${line}`).join('\n') : ''}`,
```

## How It Works

1. **Reply Mode:** When user clicks "Reply"
2. **Check AI Content:** If AI-generated reply exists, use it
3. **Fallback to Quoted Original:** If no AI content:
   - Add separator line (`---`)
   - Add attribution: `On [date] at [time], [sender name] wrote:`
   - Quote original email: Each line prefixed with `> `

## Standard Email Format Features

✅ **Attribution Line** - Shows who wrote the original and when
✅ **Quote Prefix** - Each line starts with `> ` (standard email quoting)
✅ **Separator** - Clear visual break with `---`
✅ **Sender Name** - Uses `fromAddress.name` if available, falls back to email
✅ **Date Format** - Human-readable: "Oct 21, 2025 at 9:51 AM"
✅ **Empty Lines Quoted** - Even blank lines get `> ` prefix for proper formatting

---

## Testing

✅ **TypeScript check** - No errors
✅ **File location** - `EmailViewer.tsx` (main email viewer component)
✅ **Composer integration** - Works with `EmailComposer` component

## Impact

- **Better UX** - Reply composition matches Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail standards
- **Context Preserved** - Original email always visible in reply thread
- **Professional Format** - Clean, industry-standard email quoting
- **AI Integration** - Still works with AI-generated replies when available
