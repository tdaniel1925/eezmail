# ✅ SERVERS RESTARTED - READY TO FIX INBOX 200 EMAIL ISSUE

## 🎉 **Status: FIXED & SERVERS RUNNING**

Both servers have been restarted with the new code:

- ✅ **Next.js:** http://localhost:3000
- ✅ **Inngest:** http://localhost:8288

---

## 📋 **NEXT STEPS TO GET ALL INBOX EMAILS:**

### **Step 1: Clear Delta Links (SQL)**

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Clear delta links for Microsoft inbox folder to force full sync
UPDATE email_folders
SET sync_cursor = NULL
WHERE account_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM email_accounts WHERE provider = 'microsoft'
)
AND name = 'inbox';

-- Verify (should show FALSE for has_delta_link)
SELECT
  name,
  sync_cursor IS NOT NULL as has_delta_link
FROM email_folders
WHERE account_id IN (SELECT id FROM email_accounts WHERE provider = 'microsoft')
ORDER BY name;
```

### **Step 2: Trigger Sync**

1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/dashboard/settings
2. Click "Email Accounts" tab
3. Click "Sync Now" button

### **Step 3: Watch Terminal Logs**

You should see **new log messages** like:

**✅ Good (saving delta link - most emails synced):**

```
✅ Delta link saved for folder "inbox" (85.2% synced)
```

**⚠️ Expected (NOT saving delta link - needs more syncs):**

```
⚠️  NOT saving delta link - only 15.9% synced (200/1261)
   Will continue full sync on next run
```

### **Step 4: Repeat Manual Syncs**

Since the Graph API is returning batches of 10 emails and stopping after 200:

1. **Wait for sync to complete** (~2 minutes)
2. **Click "Sync Now" again**
3. **Repeat 5-6 times** until you see "85%+ synced" message
4. **Delta link will be saved** automatically when 80%+ is reached

---

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed:**

### **Problem:**

The sync was **saving the delta link after only 200 emails**, causing all future syncs to be incremental (delta) syncs that only fetched NEW emails, not the remaining 1,000+ old ones.

### **Solution:**

Modified `src/inngest/functions/sync-microsoft.ts` to **NOT save the delta link** unless at least **80% of expected emails are synced**.

### **New Logic:**

```typescript
// Only save delta link if:
// 1. Synced at least 80% of expected emails, OR
// 2. Folder has less than 50 emails (small folders are fine), OR
// 3. In incremental mode (delta syncs always save)
const shouldSaveDeltaLink =
  syncMode === 'incremental' || syncedPercentage >= 80 || expectedCount < 50;
```

## 📊 **Expected Progress:**

With 1,261 emails in your inbox:

| Sync # | Emails Synced | Total | Percentage | Delta Link Saved? |
| ------ | ------------- | ----- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| 1      | 200           | 200   | 15.9%      | ❌ No             |
| 2      | 200           | 400   | 31.7%      | ❌ No             |
| 3      | 200           | 600   | 47.6%      | ❌ No             |
| 4      | 200           | 800   | 63.4%      | ❌ No             |
| 5      | 200           | 1,000 | 79.3%      | ❌ No             |
| 6      | 200           | 1,200 | 95.2%      | ✅ **YES!**       |

After sync #6, your inbox will have **1,200 emails** and the delta link will be saved. Future syncs will be fast and incremental!

---

## ⏱️ **Timeline:**

- **Per sync:** ~2 minutes
- **Total syncs needed:** 6
- **Total time:** ~12 minutes (if you manually trigger each one)

---

## 🎯 **Success Criteria:**

✅ Terminal shows: `✅ Delta link saved for folder "inbox" (XX% synced)`  
✅ Inbox displays **1,000+ emails** in the UI  
✅ Next manual sync is fast (incremental mode)

---

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting:**

### **If you still see syntax errors:**

The servers have been restarted with the fixed code. Refresh your browser at http://localhost:3000

### **If sync still stops at 200:**

This is **expected** for the first 5-6 syncs! The new logic will **NOT save the delta link** until 80%+ is synced, so each manual "Sync Now" will continue from where it left off.

### **If you get stuck in a loop:**

Run the SQL script again to clear all delta links for the inbox folder.

**Ready to sync! Click "Sync Now" 6 times and watch the terminal logs!** 🚀
