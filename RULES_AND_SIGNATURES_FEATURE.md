#### Creating a Signature

1. Go to Settings → Signatures
2. Click "New Signature"
3. Enter name (e.g., "Work Signature")
4. Add HTML content (e.g., `<p>Best regards,<br/>John Doe</p>`)
5. Preview in real-time
6. Check "Set as default" if desired
7. Click "Create Signature"

#### Creating a Rule

3. Name your rule (e.g., "Newsletter Filter")
4. Add conditions:
   - Field: Subject
   - Operator: Contains
   - Value: "Newsletter"

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

- [ ] Image upload support
- [ ] Import/export signatures
- [ ] Signature scheduling (work hours only)
- [ ] Per-account signatures

### Rules

- [ ] Apply rules to existing emails (bulk action)
- [ ] Rule templates (common patterns)
- [ ] Advanced regex testing tool
- [ ] Rule execution logs
- [ ] Rule groups/categories
- [ ] Import/export rules
- [ ] Machine learning suggestions
- [ ] Rule performance metrics
- [ ] Conditional actions (if-then-else)

### Integration

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **HTML Sanitization**: Signature HTML is not sanitized - needs XSS protection for production
2. **Rule Execution**: Rules are defined but not yet applied automatically (need email receive hook)
3. **Signature Integration**: Signatures not yet integrated into email composer
4. **No Regex Validation**: Regex patterns in rules aren't validated before saving
5. **No Folder Autocomplete**: Manual folder name entry (needs folder list integration)

## 💡 Implementation Highlights

### Flexible Rule System

The rule system uses JSONB for conditions and actions, allowing for:

- Any number of conditions
- Any number of actions
- Future extensibility without schema changes
- Complex boolean logic (AND/OR)

### Priority System

Rules execute in order:

1. Sorted by `priority` (lower number = higher priority)
2. `stopProcessing` flag prevents further rule execution
3. `timesTriggered` tracks usage for insights

### Signature System

- Multiple signatures per user
- One default signature
- Optional account association
- HTML with plain text fallback
- Enable/disable without deleting
