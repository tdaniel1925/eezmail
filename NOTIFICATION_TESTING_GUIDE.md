## Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Bell doesn't appear
**Fix:** Make sure you're using a page with `UnifiedHeader` component

### Issue: Notifications don't persist
**Fix:** Run the database migration:
```bash
# Via Supabase SQL Editor
migrations/add_notification_center.sql
```

### Issue: Badge doesn't update
**Fix:** Wait 30 seconds for next poll, or refresh page

### Issue: Toast doesn't add to center
**Fix:** Make sure you're importing from `@/lib/toast`, not from `sonner` directly

## Automated Testing (Future)

```typescript
// Example test structure
describe('NotificationCenter', () => {
  it('should open when bell is clicked', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it('should filter notifications by category', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it('should mark notification as read', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```
