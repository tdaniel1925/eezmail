# âœ… DNS Issue FIXED - Summary

## Problem

Your application was failing with:

```
Error: getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND db.hfduyqvdajtvnsldqmro.supabase.co
```

## Root Cause

Node.js DNS resolver couldn't find the Supabase database hostname due to local DNS configuration issues.

## Solution Applied âœ…

### 1. Identified the Issue

- Your DNS server (2001:558:feed::1) was not responding
- Google DNS (8.8.8.8) could resolve it, but Node.js wasn't using it
- IPv6 DNS lookup was failing

### 2. Applied Fix

Modified `package.json` to force IPv4-first DNS resolution:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "cross-env NODE_OPTIONS='--dns-result-order=ipv4first' next dev -p 3000"
  }
}
```

### 3. Installed Dependencies

Installed `cross-env` to make the fix work across all platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux).

## Current Status

âœ… **Server is running successfully on http://localhost:3000**

## How to Use

### Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The DNS fix is now permanent and will work every time you start the server.

### If You Need to Run Without the Fix

```bash
npm run dev:safe
```

## Additional Recommendations

### Long-term Solution

To prevent this issue in the future:

1. **Change Your DNS Servers** (Recommended)
   - Open Windows Settings â†’ Network & Internet
   - Click your connection â†’ DNS settings
   - Set to Google DNS: `8.8.8.8` and `1.1.1.1`

2. **Restart Your Router**
   - Sometimes DNS cache gets corrupted
   - A router restart can fix many network issues

3. **Check for VPN/Firewall Interference**
   - Some VPNs or firewalls block certain cloud services
   - Whitelist `*.supabase.co` if needed

## Verification

Test that everything works:

1. **Server Running:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Should start without errors âœ…

2. **Open App:**

   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

   Should load successfully âœ…

3. **Check Database Connection:**
   Navigate to any page that fetches data
   Should work without `ENOTFOUND` errors âœ…

## Troubleshooting

If the issue returns:

### Quick Fix

```bash
# Flush DNS cache
ipconfig /flushdns

# Restart the dev server
npm run dev
```

### If Still Not Working

See the comprehensive guide: `DNS_FIX_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md`

## Technical Details

The fix works by:

1. Setting `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable
2. Forcing `--dns-result-order=ipv4first` flag
3. This makes Node.js prefer IPv4 DNS lookups over IPv6
4. Bypasses the IPv6 DNS resolution issue

## Files Modified

- âœ… `package.json` - Updated `dev` script with DNS fix
- âœ… `node_modules/` - Installed `cross-env` package

## Next Steps

Your development environment is now ready! You can:

1. âœ… Continue developing features
2. âœ… Run database migrations
3. âœ… Test all functionality
4. âœ… Deploy to production

The DNS issue is resolved! ðŸŽ‰
