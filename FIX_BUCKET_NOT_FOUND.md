# üö® FIX: "Bucket not found" Error

## Problem

When clicking attachments, you get:

```json
{
  "statusCode": "404",
  "error": "Bucket not found",
  "message": "Bucket not found"
}
```

This means the Supabase Storage bucket `email-attachments` **doesn't exist yet**.

---

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION: Create the Storage Bucket

### Option 1: Via Supabase Dashboard (EASIEST)

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard:**
   - https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project

2. **Navigate to Storage:**
   - Click "Storage" in left sidebar
   - Click "Create a new bucket"

3. **Create the bucket:**

   ```
   Name: email-attachments
   Public: NO (keep it private)
   File size limit: 50MB (or your preference)
   Allowed MIME types: Leave empty (allow all)
   ```

4. **Click "Create bucket"**

5. **Set up RLS policies** (you already have the SQL in `RLS_POLICIES_FIX_NOW.md`):
   - Go to Storage ‚Üí email-attachments ‚Üí Policies
   - Or go to SQL Editor
   - Run the SQL from `RLS_POLICIES_FIX_NOW.md` (Step 2)

---

### Option 2: Via SQL (if Dashboard fails)

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Create the storage bucket
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
VALUES ('email-attachments', 'email-attachments', false, 52428800, NULL)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;
```

Then run the RLS policies from `RLS_POLICIES_FIX_NOW.md`.

---

## üîç Verify Bucket Exists

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
SELECT * FROM storage.buckets WHERE id = 'email-attachments';
```

Should return:

```
id                 | name              | public | file_size_limit | allowed_mime_types
email-attachments  | email-attachments | false  | 52428800        | NULL
```

## üéØ After Creating Bucket

### Test Download:

1. Go back to `/dashboard/attachments`
2. Click on "Letter*to_Trent_Daniel*-\_10-17-25.pdf"
3. Should now download successfully!

### If Still Failing:

The file might not have been uploaded to storage yet. The logs show:

```
‚úÖ Uploaded and saved attachment: Letter to Trent Daniel - 10-17-25.pdf
```

But this might have failed silently if the bucket didn't exist.

**Solution:** Use the **Reset button** to re-sync all attachments:

1. Click orange "Reset" button on attachments page
2. Confirm reset
3. Wait for page refresh
4. Wait 30-60 seconds for background sync
5. Refresh page
6. Try downloading again

## üìä Quick Status Check

**Check if bucket exists:**

```sql
SELECT id, name, public FROM storage.buckets WHERE id = 'email-attachments';
```

**Check if files are in storage:**

```sql
SELECT name, bucket_id, created_at
FROM storage.objects
WHERE bucket_id = 'email-attachments'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Check attachment metadata:**

```sql
SELECT
  original_filename,
  download_status,
  storage_url,
  storage_key,
  created_at
FROM email_attachments
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## üêõ Why This Happened

The attachment system was built assuming the storage bucket existed, but it needs to be created manually in Supabase first. The bucket creation step was documented in `SUPABASE_STORAGE_SETUP.md` but might have been missed.

---

## ‚úÖ Expected Result

After creating the bucket:

- Attachments download successfully
- Preview modal shows file content
- No "Bucket not found" errors
- Files stored securely in Supabase Storage

---

**TL;DR:**

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Storage
2. Create bucket named `email-attachments` (private)
3. Run RLS policies SQL from `RLS_POLICIES_FIX_NOW.md`
4. Click "Reset" button on attachments page
5. Wait for re-sync
6. Try downloading again ‚úÖ
