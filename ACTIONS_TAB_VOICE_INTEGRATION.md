# Actions Tab Voice Features Integration

## Overview

Successfully integrated voice recording and dictation features from the **Actions Tab** to open and control the EmailComposer.

## Implementation Summary

### What Was Built

1. **Voice Recording from Actions Tab** - Opens composer and auto-starts voice message recording
2. **Dictation from Actions Tab** - Opens composer and auto-starts AI dictation
3. **Custom Event System** - Uses browser events for component communication

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/components/ai/tabs/QuickActionsTab.tsx`

**Changes:**

- Added state management for composer: `isComposerOpen` and `composerMode`
- Added `EmailComposer` component directly in the tab
- **"Record Voice Message"** button now:
  1. Sets mode to 'voice'
  2. Opens composer
  3. Dispatches `'start-voice-recording'` event after 500ms delay

- **"Dictate Email"** button now:
  1. Sets mode to 'dictation'
  2. Opens composer
  3. Dispatches `'start-dictation'` event after 500ms delay

```typescript
const [isComposerOpen, setIsComposerOpen] = useState(false);
const [composerMode, setComposerMode] = useState<'email' | 'voice' | 'dictation'>('email');

// Trigger voice recording or dictation after composer opens
useEffect(() => {
  if (!isComposerOpen) return;

  if (composerMode === 'voice') {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('start-voice-recording'));
    }, 500);
    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  } else if (composerMode === 'dictation') {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('start-dictation'));
    }, 500);
    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }
}, [isComposerOpen, composerMode]);

// Render EmailComposer
<EmailComposer
  isOpen={isComposerOpen}
  onClose={() => {
    setIsComposerOpen(false);
    setComposerMode('email');
  }}
  initialData={undefined}
/>
```

### 2. `src/components/email/EmailComposer.tsx`

**Changes:**

- Already had `useEffect` to listen for `'start-voice-recording'` event (from Contacts tab integration)
- Added new `useEffect` to listen for `'start-dictation'` event
- Auto-starts dictation when event is received
- Only starts if not already dictating

```typescript
// Listen for custom event to auto-start dictation
useEffect(() => {
  if (!isOpen) return;

  const handleStartDictation = () => {
    if (!isDictating) {
      handleDictationToggle();
    }
  };

  window.addEventListener('start-dictation', handleStartDictation);
  return () =>
    window.removeEventListener('start-dictation', handleStartDictation);
}, [isOpen, isDictating]);
```

## How It Works

### User Flow: Record Voice Message

1. User clicks **"Record Voice Message"** in Actions tab
2. QuickActionsTab sets `isComposerOpen` to true and `composerMode` to 'voice'
3. EmailComposer modal opens
4. After 500ms delay → `useEffect` dispatches `'start-voice-recording'` event
5. EmailComposer receives event → starts voice recording
6. User records audio with waveform visualization
7. Recording stops → audio attached to email
8. User adds recipients/subject and sends

### User Flow: Dictate Email

1. User clicks **"Dictate Email"** in Actions tab
2. QuickActionsTab sets `isComposerOpen` to true and `composerMode` to 'dictation'
3. EmailComposer modal opens
4. After 500ms delay → `useEffect` dispatches `'start-dictation'` event
5. EmailComposer receives event → starts speech recognition
6. User speaks → AI converts to text in real-time
7. Silence detected → AI processes and formats email
8. User edits, adds recipients, and sends

## Custom Events Used

| Event Name              | Dispatched By                      | Listened By   | Purpose                     |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------- |
| `start-voice-recording` | QuickActionsTab, ContactActionsTab | EmailComposer | Auto-starts voice recording |
| `start-dictation`       | QuickActionsTab                    | EmailComposer | Auto-starts AI dictation    |

## Benefits

✅ **Consistent UX** - Same composer experience regardless of entry point
✅ **Reusable Components** - No code duplication
✅ **Flexible Architecture** - Event-based system allows adding more triggers
✅ **Already Working** - Voice recording from Contacts tab already uses this system
✅ **Fast Implementation** - Leveraged existing functionality

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Click "Record Voice Message" in Actions tab → Composer opens → Recording starts
- [ ] Click "Dictate Email" in Actions tab → Composer opens → Dictation starts
- [ ] Voice recording shows waveform and timer
- [ ] Dictation shows live transcript
- [ ] Both features work with empty composer (no pre-filled data)
- [ ] Toast notifications appear for each action
- [ ] Can cancel/stop both features
- [ ] Audio attaches to email after recording
- [ ] Dictated text appears in email body

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:

- Add keyboard shortcuts (e.g., `Ctrl+Shift+V` for voice, `Ctrl+Shift+D` for dictation)
- Add quick action tooltips showing keyboard shortcuts
- Track usage analytics for voice features
- Add voice settings shortcut in Actions tab
