# Quick Fix: Supabase "Failed to fetch" Error ✅

## Status: Connection is Working

✅ **Network test successful** - Your computer can reach Supabase servers  
✅ **Environment variables configured** - All Supabase keys are present  
✅ **Dev server running** - Application is active on port 3000

---

## What Happened

The "Failed to fetch (api.supabase.com)" error is likely:

1. **Temporary network hiccup** - Just refresh the page
2. **Rate limiting** - Too many requests during email sync
3. **Browser cache** - Stale connection state

---

## Immediate Fix

### Option 1: Simple Refresh (Try This First)

```
1. Press Ctrl + F5 (hard refresh)
2. Or close and reopen the browser tab
```

### Option 2: Clear Browser State

```
1. Press F12 (open DevTools)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
```

### Option 3: Restart Dev Server

```powershell
# Kill Node processes
Get-Process -Name node | Stop-Process -Force

# Start fresh
npm run dev
```

## Why This Happens

### During Email Sync

When syncing emails, the app makes many database queries in quick succession:

- Fetching emails
- Processing attachments
- Checking for duplicates
- Updating sync status

If too many requests happen simultaneously, you might hit:

- **Supabase connection pool limits**
- **Rate limiting (100 requests/second for free tier)**
- **Browser connection limits**

### Browser Connection Limits

Browsers limit simultaneous connections to the same domain:

- Chrome: 6 connections per domain
- Firefox: 6 connections per domain
- Edge: 6 connections per domain

When the app tries to make request #7, it queues and might timeout.

---

## Long-Term Solutions

### 1. Add Request Queuing (Recommended)

This prevents overwhelming Supabase with too many simultaneous requests.

Create: `src/lib/utils/request-queue.ts`

```typescript
class RequestQueue {
  private queue: Array<() => Promise<any>> = [];
  private activeCount = 0;
  private readonly maxConcurrent = 5;

  async add<T>(fn: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
    while (this.activeCount >= this.maxConcurrent) {
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
    }

    this.activeCount++;
    try {
      return await fn();
    } finally {
      this.activeCount--;
    }
  }
}

export const supabaseQueue = new RequestQueue();
```

Usage in sync service:

```typescript
// Instead of:
const result = await db.select().from(emails);

// Use:
const result = await supabaseQueue.add(() => db.select().from(emails));
```

### 2. Add Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff

Already implemented in the troubleshooting guide above.

### 3. Monitor Connection Status

Add this to your dashboard to see if you're online:

```typescript
// In any component
useEffect(() => {
  const checkConnection = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch('/api/health');
      console.log('✅ Connection healthy');
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('❌ Connection failed');
    }
  };

  checkConnection();
  const interval = setInterval(checkConnection, 30000); // Check every 30s
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, []);
```

## Current Status of Your App

Based on the terminal logs you shared:

✅ **Syncing is working**

- Account status: "syncing"
- Emails being processed
- Attachments being checked

✅ **Database connections working**

- Successfully querying emails
- Processing email data
- Updating sync status

The "Failed to fetch" error was likely:

- A temporary glitch
- One specific request that timed out
- Browser connection pool temporarily full

---

## What You Should Do Right Now

**Simple 3-step fix:**

1. **Refresh the page** (Ctrl + F5)
2. **Check if the error persists**
3. **If it happens again, note:**
   - What you were doing (syncing, viewing email, etc.)
   - Time it happened
   - Any pattern (does it happen every X minutes?)

**If the error comes back frequently:**

1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for red errors with "supabase" or "fetch"
4. Share those specific error messages

---

## Prevention Tips

### Avoid Triggering Too Many Syncs

- Don't click "Sync Now" multiple times rapidly
- Let current sync finish before starting another
- The app already has auto-sync running

### Monitor Your Supabase Usage

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/hfduyqvdajtvnsldqmro
2. Click "Reports" → "API"
3. Check if you're near any limits:
   - Database connections
   - API requests
   - Bandwidth

### Free Tier Limits (Supabase)

- Database: 500 MB
- API requests: ~2 million/month
- Bandwidth: 5 GB/month
- Connection pooling: 60 connections

If you're near these limits, the connection errors will happen more frequently.

---

## Is This Fixed?

**Most likely YES** - the error was temporary.

Your network test shows:

```
TcpTestSucceeded : True
```

This means your computer CAN reach Supabase right now.

**Try the app again:**

1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Navigate around
3. Check if you see the error again

If it doesn't come back → It was just a temporary hiccup ✅  
If it comes back frequently → We need to add the retry logic above

---

## Summary

**What we know:**

- ✅ Network connection to Supabase is working
- ✅ Environment variables are configured
- ✅ Dev server is running
- ✅ Email sync is actively working
- ⚠️ You saw a "Failed to fetch" error

**Most likely cause:**

- Temporary network blip or browser connection limit

**Solution:**

- Refresh the page (Ctrl + F5)
- Should work fine now

**If it happens again:**

- Open browser DevTools and check Console for specific error
- We can then add retry logic and connection monitoring

Let me know if you see the error again!
