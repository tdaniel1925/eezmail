# AI Buttons - Final Configuration âœ…

## Overview

The email composer now has **3 distinct AI-powered buttons**, each with a specific purpose and workflow.

---

## 1. ðŸŽ¤ **DICTATE Button** (Link Button with Mic Icon)

**Appearance:** Regular link-style button with microphone icon
**Location:** Toolbar, between Template and Emoji
**Label:** "Dictate" (changes to "Stop" when active)

### How It Works:

1. User clicks "Dictate" button
2. Browser starts listening via Speech Recognition API
3. User speaks what the email should be about
4. Auto-stops after 15 seconds (or click "Stop" manually)
5. **AI receives transcribed speech and writes full email**
6. Email appears in composer

### Example:

```
User says: "Tell the team the meeting is rescheduled to Friday at 3pm"

AI generates:
Hi Team,

I wanted to let you know that our meeting has been rescheduled to Friday at 3pm.

Please update your calendars accordingly and let me know if this time works for everyone.

Best regards
```

### Code Location:

- Handler: `handleDictationToggle()` in `EmailComposer.tsx` (line 455)
- Button: `EmailComposerModal.tsx` (line 321)

## 2. âœ¨ **AI WRITER Button** (Animated Sparkle Button #1)

**Appearance:** Animated button with sparkle icon and particle effects
**Location:** Toolbar, after Emoji, before AI Remix
**Label:** "AI Writer" (changes to "Writing..." when active)

### How It Works:

1. User types brief text/notes/bullet points in composer
2. User clicks "AI Writer" button
3. **AI reads the brief text and expands it into full email**
4. Replaces original text with complete email

### Example:

```
User types:
"project complete, met deadlines, thank team"

AI expands to:
Hi [Name],

I'm pleased to inform you that the project has been completed successfully. We managed to meet all deadlines and deliver everything as planned.

I want to take a moment to thank the entire team for their hard work and dedication throughout this project. Their efforts were instrumental in our success.

Best regards
```

### Code Location:

- Handler: `handleAIWriter()` in `EmailComposer.tsx` (line 557)
- Button: `EmailComposerModal.tsx` (line 362)

## 3. âœ¨ **AI REMIX Button** (Animated Sparkle Button #2)

**Appearance:** Animated button with sparkle icon and particle effects
**Location:** Toolbar, last button after AI Writer
**Label:** "AI Remix" (changes to "Polishing..." when active)

### How It Works:

1. User writes full email text
2. User clicks "AI Remix" button
3. **AI checks and fixes spelling, grammar, and context**
4. Returns polished version with errors corrected

### Example:

```
User writes:
"i writed this emial yesteday and its got lot of erors in grammer and speling"

AI corrects to:
"I wrote this email yesterday and it has many errors in grammar and spelling."
```

### Code Location:

- Handler: `handleRemix()` in `EmailComposer.tsx` (line 402)
- Button: `EmailComposerModal.tsx` (line 374)
