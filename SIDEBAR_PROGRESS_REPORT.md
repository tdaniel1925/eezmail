## ⏳ Remaining Work (7 Tasks)

### High Priority (Need for Full Functionality)

2. **Label Management Modals** - Create/edit/delete label dialogs
3. **Smart Folder Logic** - Reply Queue, Screener calculations

### Medium Priority (UX Enhancements)

4. **Folder Context Menus** - Right-click actions on folders
5. **Drag-and-Drop for Labels** - Reorder labels with @dnd-kit
6. **Storage Calculation** - Real storage usage display

### Low Priority (Polish)

7. **Testing & Accessibility** - Screen reader support, edge cases

## 🐛 Known Issues/Limitations

1. **Folder clicks don't load emails yet** - Need to implement folder navigation
2. **Can't create/edit labels** - Needs modal dialogs
3. **Storage shows 0 GB** - Placeholder, needs calculation
4. **Reply Queue/Screener show 0** - Need smart folder logic
5. **No right-click menus** - Needs context menu implementation
6. **Can't drag labels** - Needs dnd-kit integration
7. **Pre-existing TypeErrors** - Many schema-related errors exist in codebase (not caused by sidebar work)

## 📝 Next Steps for Development

**To complete the sidebar (estimated 4-5 hours):**

1. **Folder Click Handlers** (1 hour)
   - Add onClick handlers to FolderList items
   - Route to appropriate folder views
   - Update URL and active state

2. **Label Management Modals** (1.5 hours)
   - Create label dialog with color picker
   - Edit label dialog
   - Delete confirmation modal
   - Wire up to server actions

3. **Smart Folder Logic** (2 hours)
   - Reply Queue: Find emails needing replies
   - Screener: Detect unscreened senders
   - Scheduled: Query emails with sendAt > now
   - Snoozed: Query emails with snoozeUntil > now

4. **Context Menus** (1 hour)
   - Right-click menu component
   - Actions: Mark all read, Empty folder, Settings
   - Wire up handlers

5. **Drag-Drop Labels** (1 hour)
   - Integrate @dnd-kit/sortable
   - Add drag handles
   - Update sort order in DB

6. **Storage Calculation** (30 min)
   - Calculate total email + attachment size
   - Get quota from subscription tier
   - Update ProfileDropUp display

7. **Polish & Testing** (1 hour)
   - Add ARIA labels
   - Test keyboard navigation
   - Fix any edge cases
   - Performance optimizations
