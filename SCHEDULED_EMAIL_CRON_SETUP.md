# Scheduled Email Cron Job - Setup Complete! ✅

## What Was Just Created

Successfully set up automatic processing of scheduled emails with a cron job!

---

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### 1. `src/app/api/cron/process-scheduled-emails/route.ts` (NEW)

Cron job API endpoint that:

- Processes all pending scheduled emails
- Sends emails that are due
- Updates status (sent, failed, pending)
- Handles retries (up to 3 attempts)
- Logs all activity to console
- Returns JSON status response

### 2. `vercel.json` (MODIFIED)

Added cron job configuration:

```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/process-scheduled-emails",
      "schedule": "* * * * *"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Schedule**: `* * * * *` = **Every minute**

This ensures scheduled emails are sent within 1 minute of their scheduled time.

### 3. `src/components/email/EmailComposer.tsx` (FIXED)

Added missing `Clock` import from lucide-react.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

### Automatic Processing:

```
Every Minute:
  ├─ Vercel Cron calls /api/cron/process-scheduled-emails
  ├─ API calls processScheduledEmails()
  ├─ Finds all pending emails where scheduledFor <= now
  ├─ Sends each email via sendEmailAction()
  ├─ Updates status to 'sent' or 'failed'
  ├─ Retries failed emails (up to 3 times)
  └─ Returns count of processed emails
```

### Email Flow:

1. **User schedules email** → Saved to `scheduledEmails` table
2. **Cron runs every minute** → Checks for due emails
3. **Email is due** → Attempts to send
4. **Send successful** → Status = 'sent', sentAt = now
5. **Send failed** → Increment attemptCount, retry later
6. **3 failures** → Status = 'failed', errorMessage saved

## 🔧 Vercel Deployment

### When you deploy to Vercel:

1. **Push your code** with updated `vercel.json`
2. **Vercel automatically creates the cron job**
3. **Check cron logs** in Vercel Dashboard:
   - Go to your project
   - Click "Cron Jobs" tab
   - View execution logs and status

### Cron Job Settings (Already Configured):

- **Path**: `/api/cron/process-scheduled-emails`
- **Schedule**: Every minute (`* * * * *`)
- **Timeout**: 10 seconds (default)
- **Region**: Same as your deployment region

---

## 🧪 Testing Locally

### Option 1: Manual API Call

```bash
# Call the endpoint directly
curl http://localhost:3001/api/cron/process-scheduled-emails
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "processed": 0,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-16T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### Option 2: Test with Real Scheduled Email

1. **Open email composer**
2. **Click Send dropdown → Schedule send**
3. **Schedule for "This evening" or custom time**
4. **Wait for scheduled time**
5. **Manually trigger cron** or **wait for Vercel cron**
6. **Check database** - status should change to 'sent'

### Option 3: Database Query

Check scheduled emails in database:

```sql
-- View all scheduled emails
SELECT id, to, subject, scheduled_for, status, attempt_count, error_message
FROM scheduled_emails
ORDER BY scheduled_for DESC;

-- View pending emails that are due
SELECT * FROM scheduled_emails
WHERE status = 'pending'
  AND scheduled_for <= NOW()
ORDER BY scheduled_for;

-- View recently sent emails
SELECT * FROM scheduled_emails
WHERE status = 'sent'
  AND sent_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
```

## 🔐 Security (Optional)

### Add Authentication to Cron Endpoint:

1. **Add secret to `.env.local`:**

```bash
CRON_SECRET=your-super-secret-key-here
```

2. **Update API route** (uncomment these lines):

```typescript
const authHeader = req.headers.get('authorization');
const cronSecret = process.env.CRON_SECRET;
if (authHeader !== `Bearer ${cronSecret}`) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 });
}
```

3. **Update Vercel cron config**:

```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/cron/process-scheduled-emails",
      "schedule": "* * * * *",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer your-super-secret-key-here"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## 📊 Monitoring

### Vercel Dashboard:

- **Cron Jobs tab** - Execution history
- **Functions tab** - API logs
- **Analytics** - Performance metrics

### Console Logs:

The cron job logs to console:

```
[CRON] Processing scheduled emails...
[CRON] Successfully processed 3 scheduled emails
```

Check Vercel function logs for:

- Execution times
- Errors
- Processed counts

### Database Monitoring:

Track email status:

- `pending` - Waiting to be sent
- `sent` - Successfully sent
- `failed` - Failed after 3 attempts
- `cancelled` - User cancelled

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Sending?

**Check 1: Is cron running?**

- View Vercel Cron Jobs dashboard
- Check last execution time
- Look for errors in logs

**Check 2: Database status**

```sql
SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM scheduled_emails GROUP BY status;
```

**Check 3: Time zone issues**

- Verify `scheduledFor` timestamp is correct
- Check server time vs. local time

**Check 4: Email provider errors**

```sql
SELECT id, error_message, attempt_count
FROM scheduled_emails
WHERE status = 'failed';
```

### Common Issues:

1. **"No active email account"**
   - User needs to connect an email account
   - Check `emailAccounts` table status

2. **"Scheduled time must be in future"**
   - Time zone mismatch
   - Clock drift

3. **"Failed to send email"**
   - Check email provider (Nylas/Gmail/Microsoft) status
   - Verify API keys are valid
   - Check rate limits

---

## 📈 Performance

### Current Settings:

- **Frequency**: Every minute
- **Batch size**: 10 emails per run
- **Timeout**: 10 seconds
- **Retries**: Up to 3 attempts per email

### Scaling Considerations:

If you have **many scheduled emails**:

1. **Increase batch size** in `scheduler-actions.ts`:

```typescript
limit: 50, // Process up to 50 emails per minute
```

2. **Add pagination** for large batches
3. **Use a queue** (e.g., BullMQ, SQS) for reliability
4. **Increase timeout** in Vercel settings

## 🔄 Alternative Cron Services

If not using Vercel:

### 1. **Cron-job.org** (Free)

- URL: `https://yourapp.com/api/cron/process-scheduled-emails`
- Interval: Every 1 minute
- Add Authorization header (optional)

### 2. **AWS EventBridge**

```javascript
{
  "schedule": "rate(1 minute)",
  "target": "https://yourapp.com/api/cron/process-scheduled-emails"
}
```

### 3. **Google Cloud Scheduler**

```bash
gcloud scheduler jobs create http scheduled-email-processor \
  --schedule="* * * * *" \
  --uri="https://yourapp.com/api/cron/process-scheduled-emails" \
  --http-method=GET
```

### 4. **Self-Hosted (Node-cron)**

```typescript
// server.ts
import cron from 'node-cron';

cron.schedule('* * * * *', async () => {
  const response = await fetch(
    'http://localhost:3000/api/cron/process-scheduled-emails'
  );
  const result = await response.json();
  console.log('Cron result:', result);
});
```

---

## 📖 Usage Example

### Schedule an Email:

```typescript
// User schedules email via UI
const result = await scheduleEmail({
  to: 'recipient@example.com',
  subject: 'Follow-up email',
  body: '<p>Hi there!</p>',
  scheduledFor: new Date('2025-01-20T09:00:00'), // Tomorrow 9 AM
});

// Email saved to database with status='pending'
```

### Cron Processes It:

```typescript
// Every minute, cron runs
GET / api / cron / process - scheduled - emails;

// Cron finds due emails and sends them
// Status updated to 'sent'
// sentAt timestamp recorded
```

### Result:

- Email sent at 9:00 AM ✅
- User receives confirmation
- Status visible in dashboard

---
