  <div>
    <h1 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Title</h1>
    <p className="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">Subtitle</p>
  </div>
  <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
    {/* Action buttons */}
  </div>
</div>
```

**Key Changes:**

- ✅ Removed `bg-slate-800`, `bg-slate-900` colors

<div className="flex flex-1 flex-col overflow-hidden">
  {sections.chat && (
    <div className="sticky top-0 z-10 border-b bg-white dark:bg-gray-900">
      <ChatInterface />
    </div>
  )}
  <div className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto">
    {/* Other sections */}
  </div>
</div>
```

**2. Standard Header Pattern:**

```typescript
<div className="flex items-center justify-between px-6 py-3 h-16 border-b border-gray-200/80 dark:border-white/10 bg-white dark:bg-gray-900">
  <div>
    <h1 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">{title}</h1>
    <p className="text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">{subtitle}</p>

    to: email.fromAddress.email,
    subject: `Re: ${email.subject}`,
    body: aiGeneratedDraft,
  }}
  isAIDraft={true}
