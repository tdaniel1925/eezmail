**Date**: October 18, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Feature**: Open voice recorder from Contact Actions tab

---

## 🎯 Overview

Successfully implemented the ability to trigger voice message recording directly from the Contact Actions tab in the right sidebar. Users can now:

1. Select contact(s) from the Contact Actions tab
2. Click "Record Voice Message" action
3. EmailComposer opens with recipients pre-filled
4. Voice recording **automatically starts**
5. User records message, then adds text if desired
6. Email with voice attachment is sent

---

## ✅ Implementation Details

### Files Modified

#### 1. `src/components/ai/tabs/ContactActionsTab.tsx`

**Added State:**

```typescript
const [isComposerOpen, setIsComposerOpen] = useState(false);
const [composerMode, setComposerMode] = useState<'email' | 'voice'>('email');
const [composerInitialData, setComposerInitialData] = useState<...>(undefined);
```

**Added Handlers:**

```typescript
handleOpenEmailComposer(); // Opens composer for regular email
handleOpenVoiceRecorder(); // Opens composer for voice message
handleCloseComposer(); // Cleanup when closing
```

**Added Effect:**

```typescript
// Effect to trigger voice recording when composer opens in voice mode
useEffect(() => {
  if (isComposerOpen && composerMode === 'voice') {
    // Small delay to let composer mount first
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
      // Dispatch custom event to trigger voice recording
      window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('start-voice-recording'));
    }, 500);
    return () => clearTimeout(timer);
  }
}, [isComposerOpen, composerMode]);
```

**Updated Actions:**

- **Send Email** → Calls `handleOpenEmailComposer()`
- **Record Voice Message** → Calls `handleOpenVoiceRecorder()` ✅

**Added EmailComposer Component:**

```typescript
<EmailComposer
  isOpen={isComposerOpen}
  onClose={handleCloseComposer}
  initialData={composerInitialData}
/>
```

#### 2. `src/components/email/EmailComposer.tsx`

**Added Event Listener:**

```typescript
// Listen for custom event to auto-start voice recording
useEffect(() => {
  if (!isOpen) return;

  const handleStartVoiceRecording = () => {
    // Only start if not already recording
    if (!isRecordingVoiceMessage && !voiceMessage) {
      handleVoiceModeToggle();
    }
  };

  window.addEventListener('start-voice-recording', handleStartVoiceRecording);
  return () =>
    window.removeEventListener(
      'start-voice-recording',
      handleStartVoiceRecording
    );
}, [isOpen, isRecordingVoiceMessage, voiceMessage, handleVoiceModeToggle]);
```

## 🎬 User Flow

### Before (TODO)

1. Select contact in Contact Actions tab
2. Click "Record Voice Message"
3. ❌ Toast: "Opening voice recorder..." (nothing happens)

### After (Complete)

1. Select contact(s) in Contact Actions tab
2. Click "Record Voice Message"
3. ✅ EmailComposer opens with pre-filled recipients
4. ✅ Voice recording **automatically starts** after 500ms
5. ✅ User sees waveform and timer
6. ✅ User records message
7. ✅ Recording stops (manual or silence detection)
8. ✅ User can add text to the email body
9. ✅ User clicks Send
10. ✅ Email with voice attachment is sent
11. ✅ Timeline auto-logs to contact record

---

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Custom Event Pattern

**Why?**

- `ContactActionsTab` is a client component
- `EmailComposer` is a separate client component
- Need to trigger action in child without tight coupling

**Solution:**

```typescript
// Parent: ContactActionsTab
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('start-voice-recording'));

// Child: EmailComposer
window.addEventListener('start-voice-recording', handler);
```

**Benefits:**

- ✅ Decoupled components
- ✅ No prop drilling
- ✅ No parent state management complexity
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns

### Timing

**500ms Delay:**

- Allows EmailComposer to fully mount
- Ensures all refs are initialized
- Prevents race conditions with MediaRecorder setup
