# IMAP Attachment Download Fix

**Date**: Current Session  
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED

---

## Problem

When users tried to download IMAP attachments from the attachments page, they received a 500 Internal Server Error:

```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 (Internal Server Error)
Error downloading attachment: Error: Failed to download attachment
```

---

## Root Cause

The attachment system had two modes:

1. **Save metadata during sync** - For all providers (IMAP, Gmail, Outlook)
2. **Download on-demand** - When user clicks download

For IMAP, this created a problem:

```
IMAP Sync:
  ‚úÖ Email parsed with attachments
  ‚úÖ Attachment content available (Buffer)
  ‚úÖ Metadata saved to database
  ‚ùå File content NOT uploaded to storage
  ‚ùå downloadStatus: 'pending'
  ‚ùå storageUrl: NULL

User Clicks Download:
  1. API checks: storageUrl is NULL
  2. Calls downloadAndStore()
  3. Tries to call downloadFromImap()
  4. Returns NULL (not implemented!)
  5. Result: 500 error
```

**Why was `downloadFromImap()` not implemented?**

For IMAP, re-downloading an attachment requires:

- Re-connecting to IMAP server
- Searching for the original message by Message-ID
- Parsing the entire message again
- Extracting the specific attachment

This is:

- Slow (multiple round trips)
- Complex (message might have moved/been deleted)
- Inefficient (we already had the content during sync!)

---

## Solution

**Upload IMAP attachments to Supabase Storage immediately during sync**, since we already have the file content as a Buffer.

### Implementation

Updated `src/lib/email/attachment-service.ts` in `processEmailAttachments()` function (lines 167-213):

```typescript
// For IMAP, upload attachments immediately during sync (we have the content)
if (provider === 'imap' && message.attachments) {
  for (let i = 0; i < message.attachments.length; i++) {
    const att = message.attachments[i];
    const metadata = attachmentMetadata[i];

    // Skip inline attachments (already filtered, but double-check)
    if (att.contentDisposition === 'inline' || att.contentId) {
      continue;
    }

    // Upload to storage immediately
    if (att.content && Buffer.isBuffer(att.content)) {
      try {
        await uploadAndSave({
          emailId,
          accountId,
          userId,
          filename: sanitizeFilename(metadata.filename),
          originalFilename: metadata.filename,
          mimeType: metadata.contentType,
          size: metadata.size,
          buffer: att.content, // ‚Üê Already have the content!
          emailSubject,
          emailFrom,
          emailReceivedAt,
          isInline: false,
          contentId: metadata.contentId,
        });
      } catch (uploadError) {
        console.error(
          `Failed to upload IMAP attachment ${metadata.filename}:`,
          uploadError
        );
        // Continue with next attachment even if one fails
      }
    }
  }
} else {
  // For Gmail/Outlook, save metadata only (download on-demand later)
  await saveAttachmentMetadata({
    emailId,
    accountId,
    userId,
    emailSubject,
    emailFrom,
    emailReceivedAt,
    attachments: attachmentMetadata,
  });
}
```

## How It Works Now

### IMAP Attachments (Immediate Upload)

```
Email Sync:
  1. Parse email with mailparser
  2. Extract attachments (Buffer content)
  3. Filter out inline attachments
  4. For each real attachment:
     a. Upload to Supabase Storage
     b. Save to database with:
        - downloadStatus: 'completed' ‚úÖ
        - storageUrl: valid URL ‚úÖ
        - storageKey: storage path ‚úÖ

User Clicks Download:
  1. API checks: storageUrl exists!
  2. Fetch from Supabase Storage
  3. Stream to user
  4. Result: Instant download ‚úÖ
```

### Gmail/Outlook Attachments (On-Demand)

```
Email Sync:
  1. Check hasAttachments flag
  2. Save metadata only:
     - filename, size, contentType
     - providerAttachmentId
     - downloadStatus: 'pending'
     - storageUrl: NULL

User Clicks Download:
  1. API checks: storageUrl is NULL
  2. Calls downloadAndStore()
  3. Fetches from Gmail/Microsoft Graph API
  4. Uploads to Supabase Storage
  5. Updates database with storageUrl
  6. Streams to user
  7. Next time: instant download from storage
```

**Why the difference?**

- **IMAP**: Content readily available during sync (mailparser gives us Buffers)
- **Gmail/Outlook**: Only metadata during sync (saves API calls and bandwidth)

---

## Benefits of This Approach

### For IMAP:

1. ‚úÖ **Works immediately** - No 500 errors
2. ‚úÖ **Fast downloads** - Files already in storage
3. ‚úÖ **Simple** - No need to re-fetch messages
4. ‚úÖ **Reliable** - Don't depend on message still existing on server
5. ‚úÖ **Inline filtering works** - Signatures/logos excluded during upload

### For Gmail/Outlook:

1. ‚úÖ **Saves bandwidth** - Don't download all attachments during sync
2. ‚úÖ **Faster sync** - Only metadata saved initially
3. ‚úÖ **On-demand** - Download when user actually needs it
4. ‚úÖ **Cached after first download** - Fast subsequent downloads

---

## Files Modified

1. ‚úÖ `src/lib/email/attachment-service.ts`
   - Modified `processEmailAttachments()` (lines 167-213)
   - Added provider-specific handling
   - IMAP: upload immediately
   - Gmail/Outlook: save metadata only

---

## Console Output

### Before (Metadata Only):

```
üìé Processing attachments for email: abc123 (imap)
‚úÖ Saved 2 attachment(s) metadata
```

**Database:**

```
download_status: 'pending'
storage_url: NULL
storage_key: NULL
```

### After (With Upload):

```
üìé Processing attachments for email: abc123 (imap)
üíæ Uploading attachment: document.pdf
‚úÖ Uploaded attachment: attachments/user-id/2025/10/1729430200000-document.pdf
‚úÖ Saved 2 attachment(s) metadata
```

**Database:**

```
download_status: 'completed'
storage_url: 'https://[project].supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/email-attachments/...'
storage_key: 'attachments/user-id/2025/10/1729430200000-document.pdf'
```

## Testing

### Test Case 1: New IMAP Email with PDF

1. **Send email** with PDF attachment to your IMAP account
2. **Watch terminal** during sync:
   ```
   üìé Processing attachments for email: xyz789 (imap)
   üíæ Uploading attachment: report.pdf
   ‚úÖ Uploaded attachment: attachments/.../report.pdf
   ‚úÖ Saved 1 attachment(s) metadata
   ```
3. **Visit attachments page** - Should see the PDF
4. **Click download** - Should download instantly (no 500 error!)

### Test Case 2: Email with Signature

1. **Send email** with logo in signature + real attachment
2. **Watch terminal**:
   ```
   üìé Processing attachments for email: xyz790 (imap)
   üíæ Uploading attachment: invoice.pdf
   ‚úÖ Uploaded attachment: attachments/.../invoice.pdf
   ‚úÖ Saved 1 attachment(s) metadata
   ```
   (Note: Only 1 attachment - signature logo was filtered out)
3. **Attachments page** - Should show only the invoice

### Test Case 3: Gmail Attachment (On-Demand)

1. **Sync Gmail** with attachment
2. **Terminal shows**:
   ```
   üìé Processing attachments for email: gmail123 (gmail)
   ‚úÖ Saved 1 attachment(s) metadata
   ```
   (No upload yet - just metadata)
3. **Click download** for first time:
   ```
   ‚¨áÔ∏è Downloading attachment: attachment-id
   üíæ Uploading to storage...
   ‚úÖ Attachment downloaded and stored
   ```
4. **Click download again** - Instant from storage!

## Storage Structure

Attachments are stored in Supabase Storage:

```
email-attachments/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ attachments/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {userId}/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {year}/
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {month}/
                ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {timestamp}-{filename}
```

**Example:**

```
email-attachments/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ attachments/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bc958faa-efe4-4136-9882-789d9b161c6a/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025/
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 10/
                ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1729430200000-report.pdf
                ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1729430201234-invoice.pdf
                ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 1729430205678-presentation.pptx
```

## Technical Notes

### Why Not Upload All Attachments Immediately?

**IMAP:** Yes, because:

- Content is readily available (Buffer in memory)
- Minimal overhead (already parsing message)
- Simpler architecture

**Gmail/Outlook:** No, because:

- Requires separate API call per attachment
- Can be large (hundreds of MB)
- User might never download them
- Sync would be much slower

### Error Handling

The upload process includes error handling:

```typescript
try {
  await uploadAndSave({ ... });
} catch (uploadError) {
  console.error(`Failed to upload IMAP attachment ${filename}:`, uploadError);
  // Continue with next attachment even if one fails
}
```

This ensures:

- One failed upload doesn't block the entire sync
- Other attachments still get uploaded
- Email sync continues even if attachment upload fails
