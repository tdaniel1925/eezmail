# Chatbot Contact Search Fix

## Issue

The chatbot was returning a 501 error when trying to search contacts with queries like "send an email to sella hall". The error occurred because:

1. The `search_contacts` function was defined in the OpenAI function tools
2. But it wasn't wired up in the execution API endpoint
3. The handler was just a stub that returned "Not yet implemented"

## Error Logs

```
ðŸ“ž [Function Call] search_contacts: { query: 'sella hall' }
âš¡ [Execute] Function: search_contacts { query: 'sella hall' }
POST /api/chat/execute 501 in 671ms
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `/src/app/api/chat/execute/route.ts`

- Added imports for `searchContactsHandler` and `createContactHandler`
- Added switch cases for `search_contacts` and `create_contact` functions
- Now properly routes contact-related function calls to their handlers

### 2. Implemented `searchContactsHandler` in `/src/lib/chat/function-handlers.ts`

- Changed from stub to full implementation
- Searches contacts by:
  - Query (searches both name and email fields)
  - Specific email address
  - Specific name
- Returns formatted contact results with ID, name, email, and last contacted date
- Properly filters by user's email accounts
- Includes error handling and logging

### 3. Updated `/src/components/ai/ChatInterface.tsx`

- Added contact result formatting alongside email results
- Shows contact name and email in a clean format
- Limits display to 10 contacts (with "...and X more" for larger results)

## How It Works Now

1. User asks: "send an email to sella hall"
2. AI interprets this and calls `search_contacts` function with `{ query: 'sella hall' }`
3. Execute API routes to `searchContactsHandler`
4. Handler searches the contacts table for matches
5. Returns formatted results to the AI
6. ChatInterface displays the results nicely:

   ```
   âœ… Found 1 contact matching "sella hall"

   1. **Sella Hall**
      Email: sella@example.com
   ```

## Testing

Try these queries:

- "send an email to [name]"
- "find contact for [name]"
- "search contacts with [email]"
- "who is [name]?"

## Future Enhancements

- Add "Send Email" button next to each contact result
- Implement `create_contact` handler for adding new contacts
- Add more contact fields (phone, company, notes)
- Show recent email history with contact
