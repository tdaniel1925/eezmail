# Calendar Migration Fix

## Problem
The calendar feature was showing the error:
```
PostgresError: relation "calendar_events" does not exist
```

## Root Cause
The calendar tables schema was defined in `src/db/schema.ts` and the migration file existed (`migrations/add_calendar_tables.sql`), but the migration had never been run against the database.

## Solution
Ran the calendar migration against the Supabase database, which created:
- `calendar_events` table
- `calendar_attendees` table
- `calendar_reminders` table
- `external_calendars` table
- All necessary enums (calendar_event_type, calendar_event_status, attendee_response_status, etc.)
- Indexes for performance
- RLS (Row Level Security) policies

## Migration Command
```bash
node scripts/run-calendar-migration.js
```

## Result
✅ Calendar feature is now fully functional
✅ All calendar-related database operations work correctly
✅ Users can create, view, update, and delete calendar events
✅ External calendar sync infrastructure is in place

## Files Involved
- `migrations/add_calendar_tables.sql` - The migration SQL
- `src/db/schema.ts` - Schema definitions with Drizzle relations added
- `src/lib/calendar/calendar-actions.ts` - Calendar CRUD operations

## Related Fixes
Also added Drizzle ORM relations for calendar tables in the previous commit to enable relational queries with `with: { attendees: true, reminders: true }` syntax.
