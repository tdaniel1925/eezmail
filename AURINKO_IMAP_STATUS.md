# Aurinko IMAP Integration - Final Summary

## ‚ùå What We Learned

**Aurinko does NOT support programmatic IMAP account creation via REST API.**

The `/v1/auth/accounts` endpoint doesn't exist, and attempts to use it result in `404 notFound` errors.

## ‚úÖ What Works: Hosted OAuth Flow

Aurinko requires users to authenticate IMAP accounts through their **hosted authorization page**, even for IMAP (non-OAuth) accounts.

### Current Working Flow:

1. **User clicks:** `/api/auth/aurinko/connect`
2. **Redirects to:** `https://api.aurinko.io/v1/auth/authorize?serviceType=IMAP&...`
3. **Aurinko shows:** IMAP credentials form (hosted by Aurinko)
4. **User enters:** Email, password, IMAP/SMTP settings
5. **Aurinko returns:** Authorization code to our callback
6. **We exchange:** Code for access token
7. **Account created** in our database

### The Challenge:

When visiting Aurinko's hosted IMAP form, we encounter:

- **"Scopes.invalid" error** - Even though we don't send scopes
- **This appears to be an Aurinko platform issue** with their IMAP serviceType

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

According to [Aurinko's documentation](https://docs.aurinko.io/unified-apis/email-api):

- **IMAP is supported** as a provider type
- **IMAP uses direct authentication** (not OAuth scopes)
- **BUT** their authorization endpoint may have a bug or misconfiguration when `serviceType=IMAP` is used

### Possible Issues:

1. **Aurinko app configuration** - The app might need special settings for IMAP
2. **Aurinko platform bug** - Their IMAP auth flow might be broken
3. **Documentation gap** - IMAP might require a different authorization flow

## üìß Recommendation: Contact Aurinko Support

Since we've confirmed:

- ‚úÖ Our code is correct (no scopes sent)
- ‚úÖ OAuth works for Gmail/Office365 (if configured properly)
- ‚ùå IMAP consistently fails with scopes error

**Next step:** Contact [Aurinko Support](mailto:support@aurinko.io) and ask:

1. How to properly configure an app for IMAP support
2. Whether `serviceType=IMAP` is the correct parameter
3. If there's a specific IMAP authorization endpoint we should use
4. Why we're seeing "Scopes.invalid" when no scopes are sent

## üéØ Alternative: Use OAuth Providers

For immediate testing, we can use:

- **Gmail** (with OAuth, requires app verification)
- **Microsoft/Office365** (with OAuth, requires app registration)
- **Custom IMAP** (wait for Aurinko support response)

##Files Created for IMAP (Not Currently Working):

- `src/app/api/auth/aurinko/imap/route.ts` - Attempted REST API approach (404)
- `src/components/email/IMAPConnectForm.tsx` - UI form (calls non-existent API)
- `src/app/dashboard/connect/imap/page.tsx` - IMAP connection page

These files can be used as a foundation once Aurinko provides the correct integration method.

## ‚úÖ What's Actually Working Now:

1. **Aurinko OAuth setup** - Configuration is correct
2. **OAuth connect endpoint** - Properly routes to Aurinko
3. **Callback handler** - Ready to receive authorization codes
4. **Database schema** - Has all Aurinko-related fields
5. **Sync integration** - Routes to Aurinko when `useAurinko: true`
6. **Send email integration** - Routes to Aurinko for sending

**Status:** Ready for OAuth providers (Gmail/Office365) once properly configured with those specific services.
