## 🔧 **Technical Changes:**

### **File 1: `src/components/email/ExpandableEmailItem.tsx`**

#### **Added:**

- `onOpenComposer` prop to interface
- `inlineNotification` state for inline toast
- Inline notification UI with Framer Motion animation
- Button handlers that:
  - Show inline notification
  - Wait 800ms
  - Close popup
  - Open composer via callback

#### **Code Changes:**

**New Prop:**

```typescript
interface ExpandableEmailItemProps {
  // ... existing props
  onOpenComposer?: (mode: 'reply' | 'forward', emailId: string) => void;
}
```

**New State:**

```typescript
// Inline notification for AI reply buttons
const [inlineNotification, setInlineNotification] = useState<string | null>(
  null
);
```

**Inline Notification UI:**

```typescript
{inlineNotification && (
  <motion.div
    initial={{ opacity: 0, y: -10 }}
    animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
    exit={{ opacity: 0 }}
    className="mb-2 p-2 bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/30 border border-blue-200 dark:border-blue-700 rounded-md text-xs text-blue-700 dark:text-blue-300"
  >
    {inlineNotification}
  </motion.div>
)}
```

**Button Handler Example:**

```typescript
onClick={(e) => {
  e.stopPropagation();
  setInlineNotification('Opening composer with professional reply...');
  setTimeout(() => {
    setShowSummary(false);
    setInlineNotification(null);
    if (onOpenComposer) {
      onOpenComposer('reply', email.id);
    }
  }, 800);
}}
```

### **File 2: `src/components/email/EmailList.tsx`**

#### **Added:**

- `onOpenComposer` callback passed to `ExpandableEmailItem`
- Callback sets composer state and opens modal

#### **Code Changes:**

```typescript
<ExpandableEmailItem
  email={email}
  // ... other props
  onOpenComposer={(mode, emailId) => {
    setComposerMode(mode);
    setComposerEmailId(emailId);
    setIsComposerOpen(true);
  }}
/>
```
