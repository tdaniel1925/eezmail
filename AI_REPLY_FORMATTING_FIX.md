# ✅ AI REPLY FORMATTING FIX

## 🎯 **Issues Fixed:**

Based on the [Loom video](https://www.loom.com/share/fb8bf7417f4a4142b69104c0e658d818):

1. ❌ **AI replies weren't formatted professionally** (no greeting, no sign-off)
2. ❌ **AI was picking up random text from other emails** (context bleeding)

---

## ✅ **What Was Fixed:**

### **1. Professional Email Formatting** 📧

**Before:**

```
Thank you for your email. I'd be happy to discuss...
```

**After:**

```
Hi [Name],

Thank you for your email. I'd be happy to discuss the Life Dashboard project with you.

Best regards
```

### **2. Better Prompt Engineering** 🎯

Added explicit instructions to the AI:

- ✅ Use proper greeting
- ✅ Include professional sign-off
- ✅ Do NOT quote the original email
- ✅ Do NOT include subject line or "RE:"
- ✅ Write ONLY the reply body
- ✅ Focus on the current email (not other emails)

### **3. Improved AI Parameters** ⚙️

Added:

- `frequency_penalty: 0.5` → Reduces repetition and random text
- `presence_penalty: 0.3` → Encourages focused, relevant responses
- `top_p: 0.9` → More focused token selection
