# ✅ Draft Preview Feature - COMPLETE!

**Feature**: AI Email Draft Generation with User Review  
**Status**: ✅ **READY TO USE**  
**Implementation Time**: 1 hour  
**Date**: January 2025

---

## 📊 **Overview**

The Draft Preview feature allows the AI to generate email drafts that users can review and edit before sending. Instead of immediately sending emails, the AI can create drafts that open in the composer for final approval.

**Key Benefit**: Users maintain full control over important emails while still leveraging AI assistance for composition.

---

## 🚀 **What Was Built**

### **1. OpenAI Function Tool**

**File**: `src/app/api/chat/route.ts`

**New Function**: `generate_draft`

- Parameters: to, subject, body, cc, bcc
- Description guides AI to use this for complex/important emails
- Differentiated from `send_email` (immediate sending)

### **2. Draft Handler**

**File**: `src/lib/chat/function-handlers.ts`

**Function**: `generateDraftHandler()`

- Validates user has active email account
- Returns draft data structure
- Includes sender info (accountId, fromEmail)
- Comprehensive error handling

### **3. Execute Route Integration**

**File**: `src/app/api/chat/execute/route.ts`

**Changes**:

- Imported `generateDraftHandler`
- Added `case 'generate_draft'` to switch statement
- Routes draft requests to handler

### **4. UI Components**

**File**: `src/components/ai/ChatInterface.tsx`

**Enhancements**:

- Added `draft` field to Message interface
- Draft result handling in execution flow
- Draft preview button with custom event
- Opens EmailComposer with pre-filled data
- Toast notification for user feedback

---

## 🔧 **How It Works**

### **Flow Diagram**:

```
User: "Draft an email to John..."
    ↓
AI recognizes need for draft
    ↓
Calls generate_draft function
    ↓
Handler validates account
    ↓
Returns draft data
    ↓
ChatInterface displays message with button
    ↓
User clicks "Open in Composer"
    ↓
Custom event triggers EmailComposer
    ↓
Composer opens with pre-filled fields
    ↓
User reviews, edits, and sends
```

### **When AI Uses `generate_draft` vs `send_email`**:

**`generate_draft`** (requires review):

- "Draft an email to..."
- "Prepare an email for..."
- "Help me write an email..."
- Important/sensitive communications
- Complex emails
- When user's intent implies review

**`send_email`** (immediate):

- "Send an email to..."
- Simple, straightforward messages
- Quick confirmations
- When user explicitly says "send"

---

## 📋 **Usage Examples**

### **Example 1: Draft Request**

```
User: "Draft an email to john@example.com about the quarterly report"

AI Response:
✅ Draft generated successfully

I've prepared an email draft for you to review. Click the button below to open it in the composer.

[Open in Composer]
```

### **Example 2: Complex Email**

```
User: "Help me write an email to my boss requesting time off"

AI: Calls generate_draft with:
- to: boss@company.com
- subject: "Time Off Request"
- body: [Professional, well-structured email]

User clicks button, reviews, makes adjustments, sends
```

### **Example 3: Quick Send**

```
User: "Send a quick thanks email to jane@example.com"

AI: Calls send_email (not generate_draft)
- Immediately sends the email
- No draft preview needed
```

## 🎨 **UI/UX Details**

### **Draft Message Display**:

- Success checkmark (✅)
- Clear message: "Draft generated successfully"
- Instruction: "Click the button below to open it in the composer"
- Prominent button with Mail icon
- Primary color styling

### **Button Behavior**:

- Dispatches `open-email-composer` custom event
- Passes draft data in event detail
- Shows toast: "Opening draft in composer..."
- Smooth transition to composer

### **EmailComposer Integration**:

The custom event is listened to by the EmailComposer component (implementation already exists in the codebase). The composer:

1. Receives the event
2. Pre-fills all fields (to, subject, body, cc, bcc)
3. Opens in modal/panel
4. User can edit before sending

---

## 🧪 **Testing**

### **Test Cases**:

1. **Simple Draft Request**:

   ```
   User: "Draft an email to test@example.com saying hello"
   Expected: Draft created, button appears, opens in composer
   ```

2. **Complex Draft with CC/BCC**:

   ```
   User: "Draft a meeting invitation for john@example.com, cc jane@example.com"
   Expected: Draft includes CC field, opens correctly
   ```

3. **No Active Account**:

   ```
   User: "Draft an email..." (but no email account connected)
   Expected: Error message directing to settings
   ```

4. **Verify Send vs Draft**:
   ```
   User: "Send a quick email..." → Should use send_email
   User: "Draft an email..." → Should use generate_draft
   ```

## 📈 **Smart AI Decision Making**

The system prompt guides the AI to choose intelligently:

**Use `generate_draft` when**:

- User says "draft", "prepare", "help me write"
- Email is important/sensitive
- Multiple recipients (CC/BCC)
- User might need to review/edit
- Professional/formal communications

**Use `send_email` when**:

- User says "send immediately"
- Simple, casual messages
- Quick confirmations
- User is explicit about sending

## 📚 **Files Created/Modified**

### **Modified** (4):

1. `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` - Added `generate_draft` function tool and updated system prompt
2. `src/lib/chat/function-handlers.ts` - Created `generateDraftHandler`
3. `src/app/api/chat/execute/route.ts` - Added draft execution case
4. `src/components/ai/ChatInterface.tsx` - Added draft UI and custom event handling
