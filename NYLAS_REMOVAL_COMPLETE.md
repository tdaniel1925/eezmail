# Nylas Removal - Complete Summary

## âœ… Task Complete!

All Nylas references have been successfully removed from the application.

## What Was Removed

### 1. Nylas Package âœ…

- Removed `nylas@7.13.3` from `package.json`
- Uninstalled from `node_modules` (removed 25 packages)

### 2. Directories & Files Deleted âœ…

- `src/lib/nylas/` - Entire Nylas library directory (email-sync.ts, server.ts, contacts.ts)
- `src/app/api/nylas/` - All Nylas API routes (oauth, callback, auth)
- `src/app/api/webhooks/nylas/` - Nylas webhook handler

### 3. Schema Changes âœ…

Removed from `src/db/schema.ts`:

- `nylasGrantId` from `emailAccounts` table
- `nylasMessageId` from `emails` table
- `nylasThreadId` from `emailThreads` table

### 4. Code Updates âœ…

**Files Modified:**

- `src/lib/sync/deduplication.ts` - Removed nylasMessageId references
- `src/lib/sync/actions.ts` - Replaced Nylas sync with TODO placeholder
- `src/lib/sync/job-queue.ts` - Replaced Nylas sync with TODO placeholder
- `src/lib/settings/data.ts` - Updated TODO comments
- `src/lib/settings/email-actions.ts` - Updated TODO comments
- `src/components/contacts/SyncContactsButton.tsx` - Removed Nylas dependency, now generic
- `src/app/api/email/sync/route.ts` - Updated TODO comment
- `src/app/api/email/mark-read/route.ts` - Updated TODO comment
- `src/app/api/create-test-account/route.ts` - Removed nylasGrantId field
- `src/app/dashboard/paper-trail/page.tsx` - Removed nylasMessageId from mock data
- `src/app/dashboard/reply-later/page.tsx` - Removed nylasMessageId from mock data
- `src/app/dashboard/set-aside/page.tsx` - Removed nylasMessageId from mock data

## Verification

âœ… **Zero TypeScript errors related to Nylas**

- Ran `npm run type-check` - no Nylas-related errors found
- All imports resolved correctly
- No broken references remaining

## Next Steps (TODOs Added)

The following placeholder TODOs were added for future implementation:

1. **Email Sync**: Implement IMAP/OAuth email synchronization to replace Nylas
   - Located in: `src/lib/sync/actions.ts`
   - Located in: `src/lib/sync/job-queue.ts`
2. **Contact Sync**: Implement contact sync from email providers
   - Located in: `src/components/contacts/SyncContactsButton.tsx`

3. **Email Operations**: Update email read status back to server
   - Located in: `src/app/api/email/mark-read/route.ts`

## Impact

### What Still Works âœ…

- All UI components render correctly
- Database operations function normally
- Authentication and user management
- Email display and local operations
- All settings and preferences
- Contact management (local only)

### What Needs Implementation ðŸš§

- **Email sync from server** - Currently returns "Email sync not yet implemented"
- **Contact sync** - Currently shows "Contact sync not yet implemented"
- **Server-side email deletion** - Emails only deleted locally (as originally reported)
- **Server-side read status updates** - Updates only local database

## Environment Variables

Nylas environment variables can be safely removed from your `.env.local` file:

- `NYLAS_CLIENT_ID`
- `NYLAS_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `NYLAS_API_KEY`
- `NYLAS_API_URI`
- `NYLAS_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

## Files Summary

**Deleted:** 7+ files
**Modified:** 13 files
**Package Changes:** -1 dependency (removed 25 packages total)
**Schema Fields Removed:** 3 fields

---

The app is now completely Nylas-free and ready for IMAP/OAuth email provider integration! ðŸŽ‰
