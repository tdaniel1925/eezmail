# Search Box Fix - COMPLETE

## Problem Identified

The search box in the inbox wasn't working because the `/api/ai/smart-search` endpoint was only returning **filters**, not actual **search results**.

### The Issue:

- **EmailList.tsx** was calling `/api/ai/smart-search` and expecting `data.results`
- **API** was only returning `{ success: true, filters: {...} }` without any results
- The API parsed the query with AI but never actually searched the database

## The Fix

Updated `/api/ai/smart-search/route.ts` to:

1. Parse natural language query with OpenAI (existing functionality)
2. **Build database query** based on parsed filters
3. **Execute search** against the emails table
4. **Return actual results** to the frontend

### Key Changes:

**Added Imports:**

```typescript
import { db } from '@/lib/db';
import { emails, emailAccounts } from '@/db/schema';
import { eq, and, inArray, sql, desc, gte, lte, or, like } from 'drizzle-orm';
```

**Added Database Query Logic:**

```typescript
// Get user's email accounts
const userAccounts = await db.query.emailAccounts.findMany({
  where: eq(emailAccounts.userId, user.id),
});

const accountIds = userAccounts.map((acc) => acc.id);

// Build query conditions based on AI-parsed filters
const conditions: any[] = [
  inArray(emails.accountId, accountIds),
  eq(emails.isTrashed, false),
];

// Add conditions for:
// - Keywords (subject, body, snippet)
// - Sender (email or name)
// - isUnread, isStarred, hasAttachment
// - Folder name
// - Date range (startDate, endDate)

// Execute search
const searchResults = await db
  .select()
  .from(emails)
  .where(and(...conditions))
  .orderBy(desc(emails.receivedAt))
  .limit(50);
```

**Updated Response:**

```typescript
return NextResponse.json({
  success: true,
  filters: searchFilters, // AI-parsed filters
  results: searchResults, // ACTUAL EMAIL RESULTS ✅
  interpretation: searchFilters.interpretation,
});
```

## Supported Search Features

The AI-powered search now supports:

1. **Keywords**: Search in subject, body, and snippet
   - Example: "invoice", "meeting notes", "budget"

2. **Sender**: Search by email or name
   - Example: "emails from John", "sarah@example.com"

3. **Read Status**: Find unread emails
   - Example: "unread messages", "emails I haven't read"

4. **Starred**: Find starred/important emails
   - Example: "starred emails", "important messages"

5. **Attachments**: Find emails with attachments
   - Example: "emails with attachments", "PDFs"

6. **Folder**: Search in specific folders
   - Example: "emails in sent", "drafts"

7. **Date Range**: Search by date
   - Example: "emails from last week", "today's emails", "this month"

## How It Works

1. **User types query** in search box
2. **Clicks Search button** (or presses Enter)
3. **AI parses query** → Structured filters
4. **Database searches** using those filters
5. **Results returned** and displayed in email list

### Example Queries:

- "unread emails from Sarah" → Filter by sender + unread status
- "emails with attachments from last week" → Filter by attachments + date range
- "starred invoices" → Filter by starred + keyword "invoice"
- "emails from john@example.com yesterday" → Filter by sender + date

## Files Modified

- `src/app/api/ai/smart-search/route.ts`
  - Added database query logic
  - Added support for all filter types
  - Returns actual email results (limit 50)
  - Added logging for debugging

## Testing

1. Open the inbox
2. Type a search query (e.g., "unread emails")
3. Click the blue "Search" button or press Enter
4. Should see:
   - Loading spinner while searching
   - Toast notification with result count
   - Filtered emails displayed in the list

## Status

✅ **FIX COMPLETE**  
✅ **NO LINTING ERRORS**  
✅ **SEARCH NOW FUNCTIONAL**

The search box should now work properly with AI-powered natural language search!
