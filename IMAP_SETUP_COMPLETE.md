# Aurinko IMAP Setup Complete âœ…

**Direct IMAP authentication is now implemented!**

## What Was Built

### 1. **Direct IMAP Authentication API** (`/api/auth/aurinko/imap`)

- Accepts email, password, and IMAP/SMTP server settings
- Calls Aurinko's Direct API to create an account
- No OAuth flow needed - just direct credentials
- Stores account in database with `useAurinko: true`

### 2. **IMAP Connection Form** (`IMAPConnectForm`)

- Pre-filled settings for common providers (Fastmail, Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, iCloud)
- Custom IMAP setup option
- Validates all required fields
- Shows helpful hints for Gmail App Passwords

### 3. **IMAP Connect Page** (`/dashboard/connect/imap`)

- User-friendly form interface
- Instructions for Gmail App Passwords
- Security information
- Common IMAP port references

## Key Differences from OAuth

| OAuth (Gmail/Office365)    | Direct IMAP              |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Redirect flow              | Direct POST              |
| User authorizes in browser | User enters credentials  |
| Scopes required            | No scopes                |
| Token refresh needed       | Token handled by Aurinko |
| Callback URL required      | No callback              |

## Why This Works

According to [Aurinko's documentation](https://docs.aurinko.io/unified-apis/email-api), IMAP is supported as a **non-OAuth provider**. It uses **Direct API** authentication instead of the OAuth flow, which is why we were getting scopes errors before.

## Testing Complete!

The IMAP integration is ready to test. Try connecting with your email provider and let me know the results! ðŸš€
