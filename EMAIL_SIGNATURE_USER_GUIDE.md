# Email Signature Setup Guide

## How Signatures Work in Imbox

When you generate an AI reply, the system automatically formats your email like this:

```
[AI-generated email body]

Best regards,

[Your Name]
[Your Signature]
```

Your **name** comes from your account profile, and your **signature** comes from your saved signature settings.

## Setting Up Your Signature

### Step 1: Go to Settings

Navigate to **Settings → Email Signatures**

### Step 2: Create a New Signature

Click **"Add Signature"** and enter your signature details

### Step 3: Choose a Format

Below are recommended professional signature formats you can copy and customize.

## ⚙️ Best Practices

### ✅ DO:

- **Keep it concise** (4-6 lines maximum)
- **Include essential contact info** (email, phone, website)
- **Use consistent formatting** across all emails
- **Test on mobile** to ensure readability
- **Update regularly** when contact info changes
- **Use professional email address**

### ❌ DON'T:

- Make it too long (over 7 lines)
- Include unnecessary personal information
- Use unprofessional email addresses
- Add too many colors or fancy formatting (keep it simple)
- Include quotes or inspirational messages (unless brand-appropriate)

---

## 🎨 Formatting Tips

### Line Breaks

Each line in your signature should be on a separate line. Simply press **Enter** after each line.

### Spacing

- Use **pipe symbol ( | )** to separate items on same line: `CEO | BotMakers Inc.`
- Use **labels** for clarity: `Email:` `Phone:` `Website:`
- Use **icons** sparingly for modern touch: ✉️ 📞 💻

### Mobile Optimization

Keep your signature under 6 lines so it displays well on mobile devices.

## 🔧 Advanced: Multiple Signatures

You can create different signatures for different purposes:

2. **Formal Signature** - For corporate clients
3. **Brief Signature** - For quick acknowledgments

Set one as **Default** and switch between them as needed in Settings.

## ✨ What Happens Automatically

When you click an AI reply button (Professional, Quick Acknowledgment, Detailed Response), the system:

1. ✅ Generates the AI reply content
2. ✅ Adds appropriate closing ("Best regards," "Thanks," etc.)
3. ✅ Adds **blank line**
4. ✅ Adds your **name** (from profile)
5. ✅ Adds your **signature** (from settings)
6. ✅ Adds quoted original email below

**You don't need to include your name in the signature** - it's added automatically!

---

## 📝 Quick Setup Checklist

- [ ] Go to Settings → Email Signatures
- [ ] Click "Add Signature"
- [ ] Copy one of the templates above
- [ ] Customize with your information
- [ ] Save and set as **Default**
- [ ] Test by generating an AI reply
- [ ] Verify it looks good in the composer

---

## 💡 Pro Tip

**Don't include your name in the signature itself** - the system adds it automatically after the closing. Just include your title and contact information.

**Example:**

❌ **Don't do this:**

```
Trent Daniel
CEO | BotMakers Inc.
trent@botmakersinc.com
```

✅ **Do this instead:**

```
CEO | BotMakers Inc.
trent@botmakersinc.com
```

The system will automatically create:

```
Best regards,

Trent Daniel
CEO | BotMakers Inc.
trent@botmakersinc.com
```

## 🎯 Result

With your signature properly set up, every AI-generated reply will be professionally formatted with:

- Proper greeting
- Well-structured body paragraphs
- Professional closing
- Your name
- Your signature
- Quoted original email
