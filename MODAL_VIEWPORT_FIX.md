# Sandbox Company Modal Viewport Fix

## Issue

The "Create Sandbox Company" modal was extending beyond the viewport, making it impossible to scroll and see all form fields, especially on smaller screens.

## Root Cause

The modal had:

- No scrolling mechanism for overflow content
- Fixed height causing content to extend beyond viewport
- No vertical overflow handling

## Solution Applied

### Changes to `src/components/admin/CreateSandboxCompanyModal.tsx`

#### 1. Made Outer Container Scrollable

```tsx
// Before
<div className="fixed inset-0 z-50 flex items-center justify-center bg-black/50 p-4">

// After
<div className="fixed inset-0 z-50 flex items-center justify-center bg-black/50 p-4 overflow-y-auto">
```

#### 2. Added Vertical Margin to Modal

```tsx
// Before
<div className="w-full max-w-2xl rounded-lg bg-white p-6 shadow-xl dark:bg-gray-800">

// After
<div className="w-full max-w-2xl rounded-lg bg-white shadow-xl dark:bg-gray-800 my-8">
```

- Added `my-8` for top and bottom margin
- Removed `p-6` (padding now managed by child sections)

#### 3. Created Sticky Header

```tsx
<div className="sticky top-0 bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 px-6 pt-6 pb-4 border-b border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700 rounded-t-lg z-10">
```

- Header stays visible when scrolling
- Has border-bottom separator
- Proper z-index for layering

#### 4. Made Form Content Scrollable

```tsx
<div className="px-6 py-4 max-h-[calc(100vh-12rem)] overflow-y-auto">
  <form onSubmit={handleSubmit} className="space-y-6">
    {/* All form content */}
  </form>
</div>
```

- `max-h-[calc(100vh-12rem)]`: Dynamic height based on viewport minus header/padding
- `overflow-y-auto`: Enables vertical scrolling when content overflows
- Padding applied to scrollable container
