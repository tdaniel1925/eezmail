# People Tab Fixes - COMPLETE

## Summary

Fixed two issues with the AI sidebar:

1. Made the Chat tab a general AI assistant (not tied to specific emails)
2. Added debugging to help diagnose the "Previous Emails" issue

## Changes Made

### 1. Renamed "Chat" to "Assistant" ✅

**File**: `src/components/ai/TabNavigation.tsx`

- Changed tab label from "Chat" to "Assistant"
- This makes it clearer that it's a general-purpose AI assistant

### 2. Simplified ChatTab Component ✅

**File**: `src/components/ai/tabs/ChatTab.tsx`

- Removed all email-specific logic and context
- No longer accepts `currentEmail` prop
- Now just displays `ChatInterface` as a general assistant
- Removed empty states and quick actions that were tied to specific emails

**Before**: Complex component with email context and quick actions

```typescript
export function ChatTab({ currentEmail }: ChatTabProps): JSX.Element {
  // ... lots of email-specific logic
}
```

**After**: Simple, clean general assistant

```typescript
export function ChatTab(): JSX.Element {
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-1 flex-col h-full overflow-hidden">
      <ChatInterface />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 3. Updated Panel Integration ✅

**File**: `src/components/ai/AIAssistantPanelNew.tsx`

- Updated `renderTabContent()` to not pass email prop to ChatTab
- ChatTab is now completely independent of email context

### 4. Added Debugging for Previous Emails ✅

**File**: `src/app/api/contacts/sender-emails/route.ts`

- Added console logs to track:
  - Incoming sender email parameter
  - Number of user accounts found
  - Number of emails found for sender
  - Any errors that occur

**File**: `src/components/ai/tabs/PeopleTab.tsx`

- Added console logs to track:
  - Current email's fromAddress field structure
  - Extracted senderEmail value
  - Extracted senderName value
  - API request/response details
  - Number of emails received

## How to Debug "Previous Emails" Issue

With the new logging in place, when you select an email and go to the People tab, check the browser console for:

```
[PeopleTab] Current email fromAddress: { email: "sender@example.com", name: "Sender Name" }
[PeopleTab] Extracted senderEmail: sender@example.com
[PeopleTab] Extracted senderName: Sender Name
[PeopleTab] Fetching emails for sender: sender@example.com, offset: 0
[PeopleTab] Response status: 200
[PeopleTab] Received 5 emails, hasMore: false
```

And in the server terminal:

```
[Sender Emails API] Fetching emails for: sender@example.com, offset: 0
[Sender Emails API] Found 1 user account(s)
[Sender Emails API] Found 5 email(s) from sender@example.com
```

## Possible Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: fromAddress Structure

**Symptom**: Logs show `fromAddress` as a string instead of an object
**Solution**: The current code handles both cases:

```typescript
const senderEmail =
  typeof currentEmail?.fromAddress === 'string'
    ? currentEmail.fromAddress
    : currentEmail?.fromAddress?.email || '';
```

### Issue 2: Database Field Name Mismatch

**Symptom**: API logs show "Found 0 email(s)" even though emails exist
**Solution**: The query uses the correct JSONB accessor:

```typescript
sql`LOWER(${emails.fromAddress}->>'email') = LOWER(${senderEmail})`;
```

### Issue 3: Case Sensitivity

**Symptom**: Emails not found due to case differences
**Solution**: Query uses LOWER() on both sides for case-insensitive matching

### Issue 4: Email Field Not Populated

**Symptom**: `fromAddress` is null or missing the email field
**Solution**: Check email sync logic to ensure fromAddress is properly populated during sync

## Testing Steps

1. Open the app and select any email
2. Open AI sidebar (right panel)
3. Click "Assistant" tab → Should show clean chat interface with no email context
4. Click "People" tab → Should show sender details and previous emails
5. Open browser console and check for debug logs
6. Check terminal for server-side logs
7. If no emails show, compare the logged senderEmail with actual email addresses in your database

## Expected Behavior

### Assistant Tab

- ✅ Shows as "Assistant" (not "Chat")
- ✅ Clean chat interface with no email-specific UI
- ✅ Works the same regardless of whether an email is selected
- ✅ General-purpose AI assistant for any queries

### People Tab

- ✅ Shows sender details when email is selected
- ✅ Shows previous emails from that sender
- ✅ Logs debug information to help diagnose issues
- ✅ Displays helpful error messages if something fails

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/ai/TabNavigation.tsx` - Label change
2. `src/components/ai/tabs/ChatTab.tsx` - Simplified to general assistant
3. `src/components/ai/AIAssistantPanelNew.tsx` - Updated prop passing
4. `src/app/api/contacts/sender-emails/route.ts` - Added debugging
5. `src/components/ai/tabs/PeopleTab.tsx` - Added debugging

## Status

✅ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**  
✅ **NO LINTING ERRORS**  
✅ **DEBUGGING ENABLED**

## Next Steps

1. Test the Assistant tab to confirm it works as a general assistant
2. Test the People tab and check console logs
3. If no emails are showing, share the console logs to diagnose further
4. Once working, remove/reduce debug logging for production
