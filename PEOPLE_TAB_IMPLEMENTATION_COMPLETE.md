## Technical Implementation Details

### JSONB Querying

Used SQL template for querying the `fromAddress` JSONB field:

```typescript
sql`LOWER(${emails.fromAddress}->>'email') = LOWER(${senderEmail})`;
```

### Contact Matching

- Queries `/api/contacts?email={senderEmail}` to check if sender exists in contacts
- Case-insensitive matching
- Displays contact details if found

### Email Navigation

Dispatches `open-email` custom event when clicking on emails:

```typescript
const event = new CustomEvent('open-email', { detail: { emailId } });
window.dispatchEvent(event);
```

### Modal Integration

Reuses existing `ContactFormModal` component with pre-filled data:

- Email address from sender
- Name split into firstName/lastName
- Opens on "Add to Contacts" button click
- Refreshes contact info after save
