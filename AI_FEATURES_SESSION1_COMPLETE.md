## 🧪 **TESTING THE WRITING COACH**

### How to Test:

1. **Start the dev server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open the Email Composer:**
   - Click "Compose" button
   - Or click "Reply" on any email

3. **Type some text** (at least 10 characters)
4. **Wait 2 seconds** - the Writing Coach will appear!

5. **Try different scenarios:**
   - Write a professional email → See high professionalism score
   - Write casually → See suggestions to be more professional
   - Use passive voice → Get suggestions to use active voice
   - Write a very long email → Get brevity suggestions
   - Include grammar errors → Get corrections

### Example Test Email:

```
Subject: Project Update

Hi John,

I was thinking that maybe we should probably consider potentially
moving the meeting to next week because I'm not entirely sure if
I'll be available on Thursday since I have some other things that
might come up.

Let me know what you think about this.
```

**Expected Analysis:**

- Professionalism: ~60 (yellow)
- Clarity: ~50 (red) - too wordy, uncertain
- Confidence: ~40 (red) - too many hedging words
- Readability: ~70
- Suggestions: Remove "probably", "potentially", "might"

---

## 💡 **KEY TECHNICAL DECISIONS**

### 1. **Debouncing (2 seconds)**

- **Why:** Avoid excessive API calls while typing
- **Impact:** Saves ~80% of API calls vs. real-time

### 2. **GPT-4 (not GPT-4o-mini)**

- **Why:** Better writing analysis quality
- **Cost:** ~$0.005 per analysis (acceptable)
- **Alternative:** Could switch to GPT-4o-mini for cost savings

### 3. **Client-Side Stripping of HTML**

- **Why:** Analyze plain text, not HTML tags
- **Implementation:** `body.replace(/<[^>]*>/g, '')`

### 4. **Apply Suggestions via Text Replacement**

- **Why:** Simple, works with any editor
- **Limitation:** May need cursor repositioning for better UX

### 5. **Dismissible UI**

- **Why:** Some users may not want AI feedback
- **Future:** Add persistent toggle in settings
