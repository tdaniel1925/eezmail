## Core Sync Engine
File: src/lib/sync/email-sync-service.ts
Importance Score: 95/100

Multi-provider email synchronization system:
- Initial full sync for past 30 days
- Delta sync using provider cursors for incremental updates 
- Intelligent batching with provider-specific limits:
  - Gmail: 100 messages/batch
  - Microsoft: 50 messages/batch
  - IMAP: 25 messages/batch
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Conflict resolution for cross-device edits

## Real-Time Sync Management
File: src/lib/sync/sync-modes.ts
Importance Score: 85/100

Three-tier sync strategy:
1. Webhook-based instant sync
   - Microsoft Graph change notifications
   - Gmail push notifications
   - < 5 second latency target
2. IMAP IDLE connections
   - Real-time updates for IMAP providers
   - Connection pooling with auto-reconnect
3. Fallback polling
   - 5-minute intervals for providers without push
   - Full refresh every 30 minutes

## Threading Engine
File: src/lib/sync/thread-service.ts
Importance Score: 90/100

Thread synchronization logic:
- Cross-provider thread mapping
- Reference-based conversation linking
- Subject line normalization
- Participant-based thread grouping
- Timeline preservation across providers

## Sync State Management
File: src/lib/sync/sync-state.ts
Importance Score: 80/100

Cursor-based sync state tracking:
- Provider-specific sync tokens
- Last successful sync timestamp
- Failed message tracking
- Partial sync recovery
- Progress calculation

## Folder Sync Logic
File: src/lib/sync/folder-sync.ts
Importance Score: 75/100

Folder synchronization rules:
- Provider label mapping
- Nested folder support
- Custom folder permissions
- Auto-creation of system folders
- Cross-provider folder normalization
