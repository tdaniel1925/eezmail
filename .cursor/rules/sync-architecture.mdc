# sync-architecture

## Core Sync Components

### Provider-Agnostic Sync Engine
Path: `src/lib/sync/email-sync-service.ts`
Importance Score: 95

Key Business Logic:
- Delta sync implementation with provider-specific cursors
- Three-phase sync strategy (metadata, headers, content)
- Provider abstraction layer for Gmail/Microsoft/IMAP
- Intelligent batching based on provider limits
- Cross-account sync coordination

### Real-time Sync Manager
Path: `src/lib/sync/real-time-sync.ts`
Importance Score: 90

Domain Logic:
- Adaptive sync intervals (30s-5min) based on activity
- Provider-specific webhook integration
- Smart polling fallback with exponential backoff
- Change detection optimizations for different providers

### Sync State Management
Path: `src/lib/sync/sync-state.ts`
Importance Score: 85

Business Rules:
- Account-specific sync progress tracking
- Multi-folder sync orchestration
- Intelligent retry management
- Conflict resolution between providers

### Threading Engine
Path: `src/lib/sync/threading.ts`
Importance Score: 85

Threading Logic:
- Custom thread ID generation
- Cross-provider thread matching
- Conversation reconstruction
- Parent-child relationship mapping

### Rate Limiting
Path: `src/lib/sync/rate-limiter.ts`
Importance Score: 80

Provider Limits:
- Gmail: 250 requests/user/second
- Microsoft: 240 requests/minute
- IMAP: Provider-specific adaptive limits
- Auto-throttling based on response headers

## Core Sync Workflows

1. Initial Sync:
- Metadata-first approach
- Progressive content loading
- Smart batching by date ranges
- Folder prioritization

2. Delta Sync:
- Change token management
- Incremental updates
- Partial sync recovery
- Modified time tracking

3. Real-time Updates:
- Webhook integration
- Smart polling fallback
- Push notification handling
- Change aggregation
