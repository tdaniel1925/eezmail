## Core Sync Engine
File: src/lib/sync/email-sync-service.ts
Importance Score: 95/100
Multi-provider email synchronization system:
- Initial full sync for past 30 days
- Delta sync using provider cursors for incremental updates 
- Intelligent batching with provider-specific limits:
  - Gmail: 100 messages/batch
  - Microsoft: 50 messages/batch
  - IMAP: 25 messages/batch
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Conflict resolution for cross-device edits
## Real-Time Sync Management
File: src/lib/sync/sync-modes.ts
Importance Score: 85/100
Three-tier sync strategy:
1. Webhook-based instant sync
   - Microsoft Graph change notifications
   - Gmail push notifications
   - < 5 second latency target
2. IMAP IDLE connections
   - Real-time updates for IMAP providers
   - Connection pooling with auto-reconnect
3. Fallback polling
   - 5-minute intervals for providers without push
   - Full refresh every 30 minutes
## Threading Engine
File: src/lib/sync/thread-service.ts
Importance Score: 90/100
Thread synchronization logic:
- Cross-provider thread mapping
- Reference-based conversation linking
- Subject line normalization
- Participant-based thread grouping
- Timeline preservation across providers
## Sync State Management
File: src/lib/sync/sync-state.ts
Importance Score: 80/100
Cursor-based sync state tracking:
- Provider-specific sync tokens
- Last successful sync timestamp
- Failed message tracking
- Partial sync recovery
- Progress calculation
## Folder Sync Logic
File: src/lib/sync/folder-sync.ts
Importance Score: 75/100
Folder synchronization rules:
- Provider label mapping
- Nested folder support
- Custom folder permissions
- Auto-creation of system folders
- Cross-provider folder normalization

Multi-Provider Email Sync System implements sophisticated provider-agnostic email synchronization:

## Core Sync Engine
Location: src/lib/sync/sync-orchestrator.ts
Importance Score: 95/100

- Delta-based sync strategy using provider-specific cursors
- Parallel sync across multiple email providers (Gmail, Microsoft, IMAP)
- Adaptive rate limiting with provider quotas:
  - Gmail: 250 requests/quota unit
  - Microsoft: 4 requests/second 
  - IMAP: Provider-configurable
- Cursor-based incremental sync with failure recovery
- Cross-provider thread ID mapping and conversation grouping

## Provider Adapters 
Location: src/lib/providers/*
Importance Score: 85/100

Provider-specific sync implementations:
- Gmail history API integration for change detection
- Microsoft Graph delta query handling
- IMAP IDLE support for real-time updates
- Custom folder mapping between providers
- Unified thread ID generation system

## Sync State Management
Location: src/lib/sync/sync-state.ts
Importance Score: 80/100

- Multi-stage sync state machine:
  - Initial Sync
  - Delta Sync
  - Real-time Updates
- Provider-specific progress tracking
- Folder-level sync status monitoring
- Sync interruption recovery system
- Cross-provider consistency validation

## Threading Service
Location: src/lib/sync/threading-service.ts
Importance Score: 90/100

- RFC 5322 compliant email threading
- Cross-provider thread detection
- In-Reply-To and References header analysis
- Conversation participant tracking
- Thread relationship mapping
- Timeline-based thread organization
