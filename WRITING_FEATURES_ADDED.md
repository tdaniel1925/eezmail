## Usage Examples

### Check Writing Button:

```typescript
// Automatically analyzes your text for:
- Spelling: "recieve" ‚Üí "receive"
- Grammar: "He don't know" ‚Üí "He doesn't know"
- Style: "In regards to" ‚Üí "Regarding"
- Clarity: Simplifies complex sentences
- Tone: Makes language more professional
```

### Smart Compose:

```
You type: "Thank you for your email. I will review the document and..."
AI suggests:
  - "get back to you by end of day tomorrow."
  - "send my feedback by Friday afternoon."
  - "schedule a call to discuss next week."
```

## Configuration

### Enable/Disable Smart Compose:

Smart Compose is **disabled by default** to prevent API errors if OpenAI key is not configured. To enable it:

```typescript
// In EmailComposer.tsx
const [enableSmartCompose, setEnableSmartCompose] = useState(true); // Set to true
```

**Note**: Make sure you have `OPENAI_API_KEY` set in your `.env.local` file before enabling Smart Compose.

### API Modes for Writing Check:

The writing check API supports three modes:

- **`full`**: Complete analysis (spelling, grammar, style, clarity, tone)
- **`quick`**: Spelling and grammar only
- **`style`**: Style and tone improvements only

Change the mode in the API call:

```typescript
body: JSON.stringify({ text: body, mode: 'quick' }); // or 'style'
```

## Performance

### Smart Compose:

- **Debounced**: Waits 1 second after you stop typing
- **Intelligent**: Only triggers when appropriate (min 10 chars, not after punctuation)
- **Fast**: Uses GPT-3.5-turbo for quick responses

### Writing Check:

- **On-demand**: Only runs when you click the button
- **Comprehensive**: Uses GPT-4 for thorough analysis
- **Visual feedback**: Loading indicator while processing
