# Login Issue - Root Cause Found

## ❌ Problem

Login is failing with: `400 Bad Request - Invalid login credentials`

This is **NOT** a code issue - it's an authentication issue.

## ✅ Supabase Connection Working

- Supabase URL: `https://hfduyqvdajtvnsldqmro.supabase.co`
- API connection: ✅ Working
- Login form: ✅ Working

## 🔍 Root Cause

The user `tdaniel@botmakers.ai` either:

1. Doesn't exist in this Supabase project
2. Has a different password than what you're entering
3. Exists but email is not confirmed

### Option 2: Check Supabase Dashboard

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/hfduyqvdajtvnsldqmro/auth/users
