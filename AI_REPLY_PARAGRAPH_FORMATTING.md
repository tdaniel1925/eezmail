# AI Reply Paragraph Formatting Implementation - Complete

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive paragraph formatting rules with proper white space for all AI reply types to eliminate "walls of text" and ensure professional, readable emails.

## Changes Applied

### All Reply Types Updated ✅

Every reply type (Professional, Quick Acknowledgment, Detailed, Custom) now enforces:

#### Critical Paragraph Formatting Rules:

1. **Greeting on its own line** with blank line after
2. **Each paragraph = 2-3 sentences MAXIMUM**
3. **Blank lines between EVERY paragraph** (visual white space)
4. **NEVER write walls of text**
5. **Closing on its own line** after blank line
6. **Sentences = 15-20 words ideal**

#### Spacing Formula:

```
[Greeting],
↓ (blank line)
[Paragraph 1 - 2-3 sentences]
↓ (blank line)
[Paragraph 2 - 2-3 sentences]
↓ (blank line)
[Paragraph 3 - 2-3 sentences if needed]
↓ (blank line)
[Sign-off],
```

## Key Improvements

### Before (Wall of Text):

```
Hi Andy, Thank you for reaching out and sharing your innovative project idea. It sounds like the Life Dashboard could provide significant value by integrating various aspects of daily life into one platform. Our team would be interested in exploring this further. Based on the initial overview, we would need to assess the technical specifications in detail to provide an accurate estimate. Typically, projects like these can range from $15,000 to $30,000 depending on complexity, with a timeline of 8 to 12 weeks for development. Best regards,
```

### After (Proper Paragraphs):

```
Hi Andy,

Our team would be very interested in exploring this further with you. Based on your initial overview, we would need to assess the technical specifications in detail to provide an accurate estimate.

Typically, projects of this scope range from $15,000 to $30,000, depending on complexity. The development timeline is usually 8 to 12 weeks from project kickoff to launch.

I suggest we schedule a meeting to discuss your requirements in more detail. This will help us understand your vision better.
