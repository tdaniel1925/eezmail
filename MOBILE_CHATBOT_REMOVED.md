# Mobile Chatbot Removed ✅

## Summary

Successfully removed the mobile chatbot (floating "Ask me anything" button) from appearing on mobile devices.

## Problem

The ChatBot component was rendering a fixed floating button in the bottom-right corner on all devices, including mobile. This could interfere with mobile UI/UX.

## Solution Applied

Modified the `ChatBot` component to detect mobile devices and return `null` (not render) when on mobile screens.

## Changes Made

### File: `src/components/ai/ChatBot.tsx`

**1. Added mobile detection import:**

```typescript
import { useMediaQuery } from '@/hooks/useMediaQuery';
```

**2. Updated return type to allow null:**

```typescript
export function ChatBot(): JSX.Element | null {
```

**3. Added mobile device detection:**

```typescript
const isMobile = useMediaQuery('(max-width: 767px)');
```

**4. Added early return for mobile devices:**

```typescript
// Don't render on mobile devices
if (isMobile) {
  return null;
}
```

## Result

✅ **Desktop/Tablet (768px+):** ChatBot floating button appears as normal
✅ **Mobile (<768px):** ChatBot component doesn't render at all
✅ **No visual clutter:** Mobile users won't see the "Ask me anything" button
✅ **Better mobile experience:** Cleaner UI on small screens

## Breakpoint Used

- **Mobile:** `max-width: 767px` (component hidden)
- **Tablet/Desktop:** `min-width: 768px` (component visible)

This matches the standard mobile breakpoint used throughout the application (also used in `AIAssistantPanel`).

## Technical Details

The `useMediaQuery` hook:

- Returns `false` during SSR to avoid hydration mismatch
- Listens for viewport changes in real-time
- Updates when user resizes browser window
- Properly handles legacy and modern browsers

## Pages Affected

The ChatBot component is used on these dashboard pages:

- `/dashboard/inbox`
- `/dashboard/sent`
- `/dashboard/drafts`
- `/dashboard/starred`
- `/dashboard/archive`
- `/dashboard/trash`
- `/dashboard/spam`
- `/dashboard/contacts`
- `/dashboard/calendar`
- `/dashboard/tasks`
- And many more...

All will now hide the chatbot on mobile devices.

## Testing

To test:

1. Open the app on a mobile device or use Chrome DevTools mobile emulation
2. The floating "Ask me anything" button should NOT appear
3. Resize to desktop width (>768px)
4. The floating button should appear
