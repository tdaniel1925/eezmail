## 3. Storage Calculation System

### Existing Implementation (Verified Working)

The storage system already correctly calculates and displays actual usage:

**`src/lib/storage/calculate.ts`** - Core storage calculation logic

- ✅ Calculates email body sizes (text + HTML + subject + snippet)
- ✅ Calculates attachment sizes from `emailAttachments` table
- ✅ Sums total across all user email accounts
- ✅ Caches results for 5 minutes for performance
- ✅ Returns formatted sizes (e.g., "1.2 GB")

**`src/components/sidebar/SidebarDataLoader.tsx`** - Loads storage for sidebar

- ✅ Calls `getStorageInfo(userId)` server-side
- ✅ Runs in parallel with other sidebar data queries
- ✅ Provides default 15GB total if no subscription
- ✅ Passes storage data to `ModernSidebar` component

**`src/app/api/storage/usage/route.ts`** - NEW API endpoint (created)

- ✅ GET endpoint for client-side storage refresh
- ✅ Returns both used and quota in bytes
- ✅ Includes formatted strings for display
- ✅ Returns subscription tier information
- ✅ Proper authentication and error handling

### Storage Quota by Tier

- **Free:** 15 GB
- **Pro:** 100 GB
- **Business:** 1 TB

### What Gets Counted

1. **Email Body Text** - All text content
2. **Email HTML Content** - Formatted email bodies
3. **Email Subjects** - Subject line text
4. **Email Snippets** - Preview text
5. **All Attachments** - Files attached to emails

### API Integration

**Support Chat Flow:**

1. User types message in input field
2. Client sends POST to `/api/chat` with:
   ```json
   {
     "message": "user question",
     "context": {
       "mode": "support",
       "previousMessages": [...]
     }
   }
   ```
3. AI processes in support mode (specialized responses)
4. Response displayed in chat interface
5. Error handling with inline fallback message

**Storage Calculation Flow:**

1. Server-side: `SidebarDataLoader` calls `getStorageInfo(userId)`
2. Queries database for:
   - Email body lengths across all accounts
   - Attachment file sizes across all accounts
3. Results cached for 5 minutes
4. Passed to `ModernSidebar` → `ProfileDropUp`
5. Display with animated progress bar

## 9. Developer Notes

### Important Considerations

1. **Phone Number** - Update `1-800-555-1234` to actual support number
2. **Email Address** - `support@easemail.com` should be monitored
3. **AI Context** - Support mode prompts in `/api/chat` may need tuning
4. **Storage Tiers** - Update tier quotas based on subscription plans
5. **Cache Duration** - 5-minute storage cache can be adjusted if needed

### Environment Variables (None Required)

- No new environment variables needed
- Uses existing Supabase and database connections
- Uses existing AI chat API

### Performance Notes

- Storage calculation is cached for 5 minutes
- Support chat API calls are async (non-blocking)
- Sidebar loads storage data server-side (fast initial render)
- No client-side storage polling (saves resources)
