Hi Andy,

Thank you for reaching out about the Life Dashboard project. This sounds like an exciting concept!

I'd be very interested in reviewing the technical specifications you mentioned. The idea of integrating Email, Calendar, ToDo Lists, and AI-powered efficiency improvements into one hub is comprehensive.

Let me know when would be a good time to discuss development options and cost estimates. I'm available this week if that works for you.

Best regards,
