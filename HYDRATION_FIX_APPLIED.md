# ✅ Hydration Error Fixed

## What Was the Problem?

React hydration errors occur when the HTML rendered on the server doesn't match what React renders on the client. In your case:

**Root Cause:** The `getTimeAgo()` function returns different values on server vs client because time progresses between server render and client hydration.

## The Fix

### File: `src/components/email/ExpandableEmailItem.tsx`

**Line 335:** Changed from `email.sentAt` to `email.receivedAt`

```typescript
// Before
const timeAgo = getTimeAgo(email.sentAt || email.createdAt);

// After
const timeAgo = getTimeAgo(email.receivedAt || email.createdAt);
```

**Line 416:** Added `suppressHydrationWarning` attribute

```typescript
// Before
<span className="text-xs flex-shrink-0 transition-colors">
  {timeAgo}
</span>

// After
<span
  className="text-xs flex-shrink-0 transition-colors"
  suppressHydrationWarning
>
  {timeAgo}
</span>
```

## Why This Works

1. **`suppressHydrationWarning`** tells React: "It's okay if this content differs between server and client"
2. **`email.receivedAt`** ensures we use the correct date field (actual email received time, not DB created time)

## What to Do Next

1. **Hard Refresh Your Browser:**
   - Windows: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`

2. **Verify the Fix:**
   - Open http://localhost:3000/dashboard/inbox
   - Check browser console - hydration errors should be gone
   - Dates should display correctly

3. **If Errors Persist:**
   - Stop dev server (Ctrl+C)
   - Clear Next.js cache: `rm -rf .next` (or delete `.next` folder)
   - Restart: `npm run dev`
   - Hard refresh browser again

## What Was Fixed

✅ Hydration mismatch on time display
✅ Using correct date field (`receivedAt` instead of `sentAt`)
✅ Dates now show accurately (emails from August won't show as "now")

## Technical Details

**The `suppressHydrationWarning` attribute:**

- Only suppresses the warning for that specific element
- Doesn't affect functionality - just tells React "this difference is expected"
- Commonly used for:
  - Time displays
  - Timestamps
  - User-specific content
  - Random/dynamic content
