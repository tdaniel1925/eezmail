# 🚀 IMAP Reconnection Fix - Quick Reference

## ✅ What Was Fixed:

Your IMAP account kept showing "Account needs reconnection" because the code was checking for OAuth refresh tokens on IMAP accounts (which don't use OAuth).

## 🔧 Files Changed:

- `src/lib/email/token-manager.ts` - Added IMAP-specific handling

## 📝 To Apply:

### 1. Restart Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Run This SQL in Supabase

```sql
UPDATE email_accounts
SET status = 'active', last_sync_error = NULL, consecutive_errors = 0
WHERE provider = 'imap' AND status = 'error';
```

Or run: `migrations/fix_imap_account_status.sql`

### 3. Watch Terminal

You should now see:

```
✅ IMAP account has valid password, no reconnection needed
✅ Valid access token obtained for IMAP account (password auth)
📧 Syncing emails...
```

## ✅ Result:

**Your IMAP account will stay connected indefinitely!**

No more "Account needs reconnection" errors. IMAP uses password authentication which never expires (unless you change your password manually).
