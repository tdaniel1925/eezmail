# AI Buttons - Troubleshooting Guide

## Issues Fixed ✅

### Issue 1: AI Text Not Appearing After Processing

**Problem:** After clicking AI Remix or AI Writer, the toast showed success but text didn't update in the editor.

**Root Cause:** The RichTextEditor's `useEffect` wasn't properly forcing a re-render when content changed.

**Fix Applied:**

```typescript
// Before (didn't force update):
editor.commands.setContent(content);

// After (forces update):
editor.commands.clearContent();
editor.commands.setContent(content || '<p></p>');
```

**Now:** Text updates immediately after AI processing! ✅

### Issue 2: Microphone Not Starting

**Problem:** Clicking Dictate button didn't activate the microphone.

**Root Cause:** Missing permission handling and error logging.

**Fix Applied:**

1. Added detailed error messages for permission issues
2. Added console logging to track speech recognition lifecycle
3. Added better error handling with specific messages
4. Added `onstart` event to confirm microphone activation

**Now:** Microphone activates with proper permission prompt! ✅

## Microphone Permission Setup

### First Time Setup

When you first click "Dictate", your browser will show a permission prompt:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Allow localhost to use your         │
│ microphone?                          │
│                                      │
│ [Block]              [Allow] ← Click│
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Click "Allow"** to enable voice dictation.

### If You Accidentally Clicked "Block"

Don't worry! You can fix it:

**Chrome/Edge:**

1. Click the 🔒 lock icon in address bar (left of URL)
2. Find "Microphone" in the dropdown
3. Change from "Block" to "Allow"
4. Refresh the page (F5)

**Firefox:**

1. Click the 🔒 lock icon in address bar
2. Click "Connection secure" → "More Information"

## Console Logging

Open browser console (F12) to see helpful logs:

### When Dictate Works Correctly:

```
🎤 Attempting to start speech recognition...
🎤 Speech recognition started
🎤 Transcribed: Tell John the meeting is tomorrow
✨ AI is writing your email from voice...
```

### If Permission Denied:

```
🎤 Attempting to start speech recognition...
Dictation error: not-allowed
```

→ **Fix:** Allow microphone permission (see above)

### If No Speech Detected:

```
🎤 Speech recognition started
Dictation error: no-speech
```

→ **Fix:** Speak louder or check microphone settings
