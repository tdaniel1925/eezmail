# üîå Nylas Setup Guide - Connect Your Email Account

## ‚úÖ Current Status

Your Nylas integration is **fully built** and ready to use! Here's what's already done:

- ‚úÖ OAuth flow implemented (`/api/nylas/auth` and `/api/nylas/callback`)
- ‚úÖ Contact sync functionality (`syncContactsFromNylas`)
- ‚úÖ Email sync infrastructure (ready)
- ‚úÖ ConnectedAccounts UI in settings
- ‚úÖ SyncContactsButton component
- ‚úÖ Database schema for email accounts

## üöÄ What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Get Nylas Credentials

1. **Sign up for Nylas** (if you haven't already)
   - Go to: https://dashboard.nylas.com/register
   - Sign up for a free account

2. **Create a Nylas Application**
   - After logging in, click "Create Application"
   - Choose "V3 Application" (latest version)
   - Name it something like "Imbox Email Client - Dev"

3. **Get Your API Credentials**
   You'll need 4 keys from your Nylas dashboard:
   - **NYLAS_CLIENT_ID** - Found in Application Settings
   - **NYLAS_CLIENT_SECRET** - Found in Application Settings (keep secret!)
   - **NYLAS_API_KEY** - Found in Application Settings
   - **NYLAS_API_URI** - Usually `https://api.us.nylas.com` (or your region)

### Step 2: Configure Callback URLs in Nylas Dashboard

In your Nylas application settings, add these callback URLs:

**For Local Development:**

```
http://localhost:3000/api/nylas/callback
```

**For Production (when deployed):**

```
https://your-domain.com/api/nylas/callback
```

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables

Open your `.env.local` file and add/update these variables:

```bash
# NYLAS (Email Integration)
NYLAS_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_client_id_here
NYLAS_CLIENT_SECRET=your_actual_client_secret_here
NYLAS_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
NYLAS_API_URI=https://api.us.nylas.com
NYLAS_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret_here

# Make sure this matches your dev port
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:**

- Keep these secrets safe and never commit them to git
- The `.env.local` file is already in `.gitignore`
- You'll need to restart your dev server after changing environment variables

### Step 4: Restart Your Dev Server

```bash
# Stop your current dev server (Ctrl+C)
# Then start it again
npm run dev
```

### Step 5: Connect Your Email Account

1. **Navigate to Settings**

   ```
   http://localhost:3000/dashboard/settings
   ```

2. **Go to "Email Accounts" Tab**
   - You should see a section called "Connected Email Accounts"
3. **Click "Add Email Account"**
   - Choose your provider (Gmail or Microsoft)
   - You'll be redirected to the OAuth consent screen

4. **Grant Permissions**
   - Sign in with your email account
   - Allow access to:
     - ‚úÖ Email
     - ‚úÖ Contacts
     - ‚úÖ Calendar

5. **You'll be redirected back**
   - If successful, you'll see your account connected
   - It will sync in the background

### Step 6: Test Contact Sync

1. **Go to Contacts Page**

   ```
   http://localhost:3000/dashboard/contacts
   ```

2. **Click "Sync Contacts"**
   - This will fetch contacts from your connected email account
   - Progress will be shown with a spinner
   - Success message will appear when done

3. **Verify Contacts Were Imported**
   - You should see contacts from your email provider
   - Avatars will be fetched if available
   - All contact details will be imported

## üîç Troubleshooting

### "Missing NYLAS_API_KEY"

**Problem**: Environment variables not loaded

**Solution**:

1. Make sure `.env.local` exists in project root
2. Check that variable names are spelled correctly
3. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
4. If still not working, check: [[memory:9803359]]

```bash
# Verify variables are set (PowerShell)
Get-Content .env.local | Select-String "NYLAS"
```

### "Failed to initiate OAuth"

**Problem**: Callback URL mismatch

**Solution**:

1. Check Nylas dashboard ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí Callback URLs
2. Make sure it includes: `http://localhost:3000/api/nylas/callback`
3. Make sure `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` in `.env.local` is correct
4. Restart dev server

### "Invalid state" error after OAuth

**Problem**: OAuth state mismatch (timing issue)

**Solution**:

1. Clear browser cookies for localhost
2. Try the OAuth flow again
3. Make sure your system clock is correct

### "Contacts not syncing"

**Problem**: No grantId stored

**Solution**:

1. Check if account was properly connected
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí Email Accounts
3. If account shows but can't sync:
   - Remove the account
   - Add it again
   - Grant all permissions

### "Unauthorized" error

**Problem**: Access token expired

**Solution**:

1. Nylas tokens expire after some time
2. Reconnect your account in settings
3. For production, implement token refresh (future enhancement)

## üîê Security Notes

1. **Access Tokens**
   - Stored encrypted in database
   - Never exposed to client-side
   - Used only in server actions

2. **OAuth Flow**
   - Uses state parameter for CSRF protection
   - Validates redirect URIs
   - Secure cookie storage

3. **API Keys**
   - Keep `NYLAS_CLIENT_SECRET` and `NYLAS_API_KEY` secret
   - Never commit to version control
   - Rotate keys if compromised

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Use Gmail for Testing**
   - Gmail OAuth is most reliable
   - Google Contacts API works well
   - Avatars usually available

2. **Start with Small Dataset**
   - Test with a personal account first
   - Don't sync 1000+ contacts initially
   - Verify everything works

3. **Monitor Console**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Check server terminal for logs
   - Nylas provides detailed error messages

4. **Rate Limits**
   - Free tier has limits
   - Syncing large contact lists may take time
   - Be patient with initial sync

## üìû Need Help?

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Nylas Documentation**
   - https://developer.nylas.com/docs/

2. **Check Server Logs**
   - Look at terminal where `npm run dev` is running
   - Errors will show there

3. **Enable Debug Mode**

   ```typescript
   // In src/lib/nylas/server.ts
   // Add console.logs to see what's happening
   ```

4. **Test OAuth Flow Manually**
   ```
   Visit: http://localhost:3000/api/nylas/auth
   Should redirect to Google/Microsoft login
   ```
