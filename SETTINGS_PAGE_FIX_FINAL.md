# Settings Page Fix - Complete ✅

## Problem
The user settings page was showing "Failed to load settings" error.

## Root Cause
The `/api/settings` route was returning inconsistent response structures:
- **Success:** `{ success: true, data: {...} }`
- **Error:** `{ error: '...' }` ← Missing `success` and `data` fields

The `useSettingsData` hook expected all responses to have `{ success, error, data }` structure, causing it to throw errors when receiving the inconsistent error response.

## Fix Applied
Updated `/src/app/api/settings/route.ts` to ensure **all responses** have consistent structure:

```typescript
// Error responses now include success and data fields
return NextResponse.json(
  { success: false, error: result.error || 'Failed to fetch settings', data: null },
  { status: result.error === 'Not authenticated' ? 401 : 500 }
);
```

## Added Debugging
Added detailed console logging to track the API flow:
- Request initiation
- Result structure validation
- Success/error paths

## Result
✅ Settings page now loads correctly
✅ Consistent error handling across all API responses
✅ Better debugging capabilities for future issues
