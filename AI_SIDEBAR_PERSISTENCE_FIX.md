# AI Sidebar Persistence Fix - The Real Fix

## The Root Cause

The AI sidebar was using **Zustand's persist middleware** which saves ALL state to `localStorage`. This meant:

❌ **`currentEmail` was being saved** → Persisted across page reloads
❌ **`selectedContactId` was being saved** → Persisted across page reloads  
❌ **`activeTab` was being saved** → Got stuck on last tab

**Result:** When you refreshed the page, the AI panel would load the old email from localStorage and keep analyzing it!

## The Problem Code

```typescript
export const useAIPanelStore = create<AIPanelState>()(
  persist(
    (set) => ({
      currentEmail: null, // ❌ This was being persisted!
      selectedContactId: null, // ❌ This was being persisted!
      activeTab: 'assistant', // ❌ This was being persisted!
      // ...
    }),
    {
      name: 'ai-panel-storage', // Saves EVERYTHING to localStorage
    }
  )
);
```

## The Solution

Used Zustand's `partialize` option to **whitelist** only UI preferences for persistence:

```typescript
export const useAIPanelStore = create<AIPanelState>()(
  persist(
    (set) => ({
      // State definition (same)
      currentEmail: null,
      selectedContactId: null,
      activeTab: 'assistant',
      isExpanded: true,
      width: 380,
      // ...
    }),
    {
      name: 'ai-panel-storage',
      // ✅ Only persist UI preferences
      partialize: (state) => ({
        isExpanded: state.isExpanded, // ✅ Remember if sidebar was open
        isVisible: state.isVisible, // ✅ Remember if sidebar was visible
        width: state.width, // ✅ Remember user's custom width
        sections: state.sections, // ✅ Remember which sections expanded
        autoExpandOnEmail: state.autoExpandOnEmail, // ✅ Remember auto-expand setting
        // currentEmail: NOT persisted         ❌ Contextual, clears on refresh
        // selectedContactId: NOT persisted    ❌ Contextual, clears on refresh
        // activeTab: NOT persisted            ❌ Always resets to 'assistant'
      }),
    }
  )
);
```

## What Gets Persisted vs. What Doesn't

### ✅ Persisted (User Preferences)

- **`isExpanded`** - Whether sidebar is expanded or collapsed
- **`isVisible`** - Whether sidebar is shown or hidden
- **`width`** - User's custom sidebar width (320-600px)
- **`sections`** - Which sections are expanded (email insights, analytics, etc.)
- **`autoExpandOnEmail`** - Auto-expand on email selection preference

### ❌ NOT Persisted (Contextual Data)

- **`currentEmail`** - Currently selected email → **Clears on page refresh**
- **`selectedContactId`** - Currently selected contact → **Clears on page refresh**
- **`activeTab`** - Current tab (assistant/thread/actions) → **Always resets to 'assistant'**

## Behavior After Fix

### Before:

```
User: *selects email from e.watson*
AI: "Analyzing email from e.watson..."
User: *refreshes page*
AI: "Analyzing email from e.watson..." ❌ STILL THERE!
```

### After:

```
User: *selects email from e.watson*
AI: "Analyzing email from e.watson..."
User: *refreshes page*
AI: "Hi! I'm your AI assistant..." ✅ CLEARED!
```

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Page Refresh

1. Open an email → AI shows analysis
2. Refresh page (F5)
3. ✅ AI shows generic greeting
4. ✅ Sidebar remembers width/expanded state

### Scenario 2: Close Browser Tab

1. Open an email → AI shows analysis
2. Close browser tab
3. Reopen page
4. ✅ AI shows generic greeting
5. ✅ UI preferences preserved

### Scenario 3: Clear All Data

1. Go to Settings → Wipe All Data
2. Refresh page
3. ✅ AI shows generic greeting
4. ✅ No stale email references

### Scenario 4: Archive/Delete

1. Open an email → AI shows analysis
2. Archive or Delete the email
3. ✅ AI clears immediately (from previous fix)
4. ✅ Won't persist after refresh (this fix)

## Combined Fixes

This fix works together with the previous changes:

1. **`ChatInterface.tsx`** - Clears when `currentEmail` becomes null
2. **`EmailList.tsx`** - Sets `currentEmail` to null on archive/delete
3. **`EmailViewer.tsx`** - Sets `currentEmail` to null on archive/delete
4. **`aiPanelStore.ts`** - **Doesn't persist `currentEmail` to localStorage** ← THIS FIX

## How to Test

1. **Clear localStorage** (to remove old persisted data):

   ```javascript
   // Open browser console
   localStorage.removeItem('ai-panel-storage');
   ```

2. **Hard refresh** the page:

   ```
   Ctrl + Shift + R  (Windows)
   Cmd + Shift + R   (Mac)
   ```

3. **Test the flow**:
   - Open an email → AI shows analysis
   - Refresh page → AI should show generic greeting
   - Open email again → AI shows analysis
   - Archive email → AI clears
   - Refresh page → AI still shows generic greeting

## Benefits

1. ✅ **No Stale Data** - Contextual data never persists
2. ✅ **User Preferences Preserved** - UI settings still remembered
3. ✅ **Memory-less** - AI truly contextual to active email only
4. ✅ **Clean State** - Every page load starts fresh
5. ✅ **Better UX** - No confusion about what's being analyzed

---

**Status:** ✅ AI sidebar now truly contextual (no persistence of email data)
**Date:** 2025-10-19
**Files Changed:**

- `src/stores/aiPanelStore.ts` - Added `partialize` to exclude contextual data

**Related Fixes:**

- `AI_PANEL_AUTO_CLEAR.md` - Auto-clear on archive/delete/navigate
- This fix ensures cleared state doesn't come back after refresh
